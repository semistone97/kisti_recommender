      " BACKGROUND: 'Architectural Urbanism: Melbourne/Seoul' was a two-city exhibition funded by RMIT University and the Korean National University, supported by the Australian Government through the Australian International Cultural Council. Kerstin Thompson Architecture (KTA) showed five works - Carrum Downs Police Station, MUMA Gallery, Lake Conneware House, Napier Street Housing and Royal Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre - as one of ten architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected to exhibit. The exhibited work included large scale photographs, working drawings and exegetical text. CONTRIBUTION: The exhibition explored architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. Within this context, the public projects exhibited by KTA explore relationships between interior and exterior, building and street, and the existing and the new. This draws on Thompson's ongoing practice and design research focussing on architecture as a civic endeavour, forging connections between buildings, their surroundings and the people who inhabit them. SIGNIFICANCE: 'Architectural Urbanism' was an international, cross institutional exhibition that received external funding, evidencing significance for the selected works by the 10 participating practices. In Seoul, the exhibition was opened by the deputy Australian Ambassador. The Melbourne exhibition was reviewed in Architecture Australia (AA). These KTA projects have also received multiple awards and media attention including four AIA (Australian Institute of Architects) Victorian Architecture Awards, an IDEA (Interior Design Excellence Awards) award, three book features, critical reviews in AA, and articles in SMH, The Australian, Broadsheet and Archdaily.\n",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Court House, George+Murphy House, Fitzroy Community School Creative Space and Rose House are 4 exemplar works of Baracco + Wright Architects, spanning over a diverse range of locations from inner urban areas to sensitive rural and coastal environments. These projects were selected for exhibition in the reciprocal international Seoul/Melbourne exhibition, 'Architectural Urbanism'. Baracco + Wright was one of ten young architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected for inclusion in the event. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Exhibition curator Melanie Dodd said 'Architectural Urbanism' would explore architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. The 4 selected works by B+W exemplify this approach, by sharing common ground which transcends their formal differences because of how they play with the threshold and boundaries of urban site conditions as a means to reinterpret the ordinary. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The Court House was the only one of these 4 works not previously published. The selection of these projects as examples of 'architectural urbanism' inserts this body of work into broader intercultural conversation. The exhibition was funded by RMIT and the Korean National University. The project received external support from the Australian Government through the Australian International Cultural Council: an initiative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The exhibition was opened by the deputy Australian Ambassador in Seoul. A reciprocal exhibition, co-curated by Jong-Kyu Kim, was subsequently held at RMIT's Design Hub.",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Urban Box was one of 4 projects by Iredale Pedersen Hook (IPH) selected for exhibition in the reciprocal international Seoul/Melbourne exhibition, 'Architectural Urbanism' (the others were Sheep House, Grace Park House and Innocent Bystander winery). IPH was one of 10 firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) who participated. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Urban Box is a solid little building in Port Melbourne, an inner-city Melbourne suburb of single-fronted timber Victorian workers cottages, high-rise apartments, public housing and light industry. It is the prototype of a collection of small houses by IPH that uses the insulated concrete sandwich precast panel system, Thermomass. The site is 99m2; the subdivision of an already small piece of land. The house shifts the typology of infill housing towards a responsive and sustainable approach with a sense of material quality.

RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: Urban Box was published in Australian Home Beautiful in Feb 2012. Its selection for inclusion in this international event inserts the project into broader intercultural conversation. The exhibition was funded by RMIT and the Korean National University. The project received external support from the Australian Government through the Australian International Cultural Council: an initiative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. A reciprocal exhibition, co-curated by Jong-kyu Kim, was subsequently held at RMIT's Design Hub.",

The work contributes to Urban Design, specifically exploring evolutionary adaptation of contemporary Australian urban typologies. The work contributes to the areas of research being undertaken by among others, Kristine Sampson, Christopher M. Lee, Series Architects & Tom Verebes. CONTRIBUTION In order to explore the curatorial proposition of the Now&When exhibition; to imagine the future of Australian urban environments, the Saturation City project manufactured a crisis - a rise in sea level of 20m, tested around Melbourne and Port Philip Bay. Four key Australian urban typologies; the park/garden, the CBD, the suburb and the coastline, were subjected to dramatic densifications in response to the 'flood', acknowledging that future urbanism with be informed by existing models and modified by emerging requirements. Presenting a view of evolutionary urban transformation in the grafting of new and old conditions to produce hybrid urban forms. SIGNIFICANCE The work's significance is demonstrated through its initial selection via two stage competition judged by leading peers to represent Australia in the context the of the 2010 Venice Architecture Biennale. The work was subsequently shown in Brisbane, Beijing, Bendigo, Delhi, Kaohsiung, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Mumbai, Perth, Sydney, Seoul, Taipei & Adelaide. The work has been reviewed in numerous periodicals, including Architecture Australia (May/June 2010 & Sept/Oct 2010), Architecture Review (October 2010) & Architecture Victoria (Spring 2014). The work has been featured in a number of commercial publications including Futuristic (DAAB, Cologne, 2012) & Utopia Forever: Visions of Architecture and Urbanism (Gestalten, Berlin, 2011), and has been used in a case study by The United Kingdom's Office fo",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: The 'Urban Still Life (with mops and brooms): Beijing version' installation depicted an informal occupation of the public realm that lies outside of ownership and traditional property lines, and blurs the edges between public and private, civic and domestic. The project was conceived to be cumulative and comparative as it travelled to three Asian cities; local images were added in Beijing to those collected in previous exhibitions in Seoul and Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: This work builds upon research in bottom-up or micro-urbanism strategies in the Asian city. It develops observational and participatory techniques to enable the general public to engage with urban design issues by contributing to the exhibition with text and images. This work marks a significant shift within Asia. Instead of looking to the West for solutions to contemporary urban design issues, this research proposes that Asia is now providing more appropriate models to deal with the complexity that is facing both eastern and western cities. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project received funding support from VESKI (Victorian State Government: $20,000 for four exhibitions). It was exhibited by invitation in CU Space Gallery, the first architecture gallery in China in the prestigious 798 Art Zone. The exhibition and symposium were widely peer-reviewed on the web and in a Chinese architectural journal. As a result of this exhibition, Helsel was invited to develop this research in the curated 'Always on My Mind: Home' exhibition at the Museum of Art at Seoul National University with significant international grant funding.",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Mobile Landscapes (III) was developed as a new key project for the curatorial theme 'Ephemeral Architectures' for the X-Field Archive (as part of the exhibition Neighbouring Effect, Seoul, Korea, and for subsequent iterations). Mobile Landscapes is a mapping of the Murray River, building upon several years of archival research of its flood histories. It comprises: a line drawing of the 2500-kilometre river system (15 A4 sheets of drafting film), and 15 photographic recordings (each A6 format) of a 24 kilometre walk undertaken (in 2001) across the '1956 floodplain'. The line drawing shows the existing river, the shoreline of a 1:100 year flood event (1956) and the survey grids of existing river towns. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The major contribution is within the scholarship of site studies in architecture, and has particular relevance as an approach to uncovering invisible site histories. This knowledge is useful in the design process as it can help the architect engage with ephemeral site phenomena as a site specific design approach. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The exhibition was curated by designer Jaewon Cho and Associate Professor Sand Helsel (RMIT). It was funded by the Arts Council in Korea, the Australia - Korea Foundation, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This project has led to several invited public lectures: at the University of Siegen, Germany, the University of Sint-Lucas, Ghent, Belgium, and at the Affirmative Architecture Conference in Melbourne and Perth. Black was invited by Curtin University, Perth, to present the annual keynote Robertson Memorial Lecture. The exhibition received peer review in SPACE magazine: Architecture, Art and Culture journal, Korea.",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: 'Carved ground' is one strand of a larger $800,000 commission for a house and studio on a steep rocky site. The exhibited component focussed upon the design of the site as a contribution to the discourse on environmental sustainability through an innovative design of the site. It was exhibited in X-Field Archive (also co-curated by the researcher), the final iteration of an international travelling exhibition that began in Melbourne in 2010 and went to Seoul, Beijing and Taipei. Black was one of six Melbourne practitioners included in the show. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: In response to the curatorial theme Preparing the Ground, the exhibit focussed upon the carved ground of the site. This concept brings a building into relationship with its site - so that external and internal environments form an integral whole. A series of new levels, terraces, spaces and edges were defined and then echoed in the crafting of the volume of the house and studio. This process was reflected in the photographs and a drawing included in the exhibition. This work extends the knowledge of a site-based approach to making architecture and deals with issues of sustainability and regimes of care. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: 'Carved ground' was part of an international touring show funded by the Victorian State Government (via Victorian Endowment for Science, Knowledge and Innovation), the Australia Korea Foundation and RMIT. This final iteration was staged at Pin-Up, a gallery funded by local government (City of Yarra) and commerical sponsors. A further example of peer review and esteem is that the 'Carved ground' house and studio work has been a component in public lectures in Australia and overseas. It has been discussed on ABC Radio National 'The Architect-Designed House, 31 Dec 2012 http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/architects/architect-designed-house/4428130. It has also lead to other commissions in Castlemaine and Bullarto South.",

         "'Peter Corrigan: cities of hope' exhibition at RMIT Gallery honoured the work of the internationally renowned Melbourne architecture practice of Edmond & Corrigan, Corrigan's set and costume design for theatre, his personal library and art collection and objects from his office. MvS Architects (Paul Minifie and Jan van Schaik) was one of 22 individuals or firms who were invited by the architecture community to respond to Corrigan's work. Four digital prints - 'Crownie', 2013 - are the result. All were included in 'The Cities of Hope' exhibition. This exhibition followed the publication of a new monograph of Edmond & Corrigan's work by Thames and Hudson. 2. Research Contribution: The researchers used Minecraft, a computer game that allows the user to construct a world out of textured blocks, as a visualisation tool. Their work, 'Crownie', re-imagined Bruno Taut's Die Stadtkrone (The City Crown) and Corrigan's iconic Building 8 on Swanston Street. This response to Corrigan's work ultimately aspires to a contemporary interpretation of it. Minifie and van Schaik's work was innovative because it involved a creative appropriate of computer-gaming software. The researchers used Minecraft - a program made for interactive entertainment - as a design tool. 3. Research Significance: RMIT Gallery is a highly-regarded Melbourne gallery. It has a long-standing commitment to innovative exhibitions that represent divergent artistic practices. 'Cities of hope' is the first major public exhibition on the work of Edmond & Corrigan, and the first major exhibition on a single architect's contribution to Melbourne architectural culture in over ten years. The value of this project is further evidenced by the 10,105 people who attended [exhibition report], the review in 'The Age' (Ray Edgar, Dreaming up a city of hope', April 2013) and the review in the leading Australian professional journal 'Architecture Australia' (Ricky Ricardo, Peter Corrigan: cities of hope', a review, May 2013).",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: X-field is an interdisciplinary exhibition that began in Melbourne in 2010 and has since travelled to Seoul, Beijing and Taipei. The exhibiton and sympoisa were supported by Australia Korea Foundation, the State Government of Victoria (via VESKI, Victorian Endowment for Science, Knowledge and Innovation) and RMIT's Design Research Institute. X-Field pays homage to Rosalind Kruas' seminal essay 'Sculpture in the Expanded Field' (1979). X-Field Archive, which featured expanded versions of earlier work, was curated by Richard Black and Sand Helsel. This research statement refers to Black's work in the show: a section and model are two key 'tools + techniques' used to by Times two Architects (TTA) to knit a new work into its existing context. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Models and section drawings from two separate architectural works were exhibited to demonstrate how they are useful tools to negotiate specific site conditions and address the curatorial themes of the exhibition. Two models of a new work showed a range of relationships between its site, form and material. Section drawings and a photograph revealed how the sectional profile of an addition mirrored and transformed the profile of the existing house within the new work allowing TTA to successfully negotiate strict heritage guidelines. The section and model make a contribution to a site responsive design process. Both pieces are a critical reflection of the design process of Black's architectural practice. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: X-Field Archive was the culminating show of a four-year international project supported by RMIT and external partners, including state and federal governments. The work of Black and five other practitioners was shown at Pin-Up Gallery, a space with external commercial and civic support from sponspors such as local governmenty (City of Yarra), Planning Studio on Peel and de Bortoli wines.",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Australian Garden is a major botanic garden on a 25-hectare site: the largest botanic garden devoted to Australian flora. Set on a former sand quarry, the garden brings together horticulture, architecture, ecology, and art, allowing visitors to follow a metaphorical journey through the Australian landscape, from the desert to the coastal fringe. Perry Lethlean, as a Director of Taylor Cullity Lethlean (TCL), led the project in collaboration with Paul Thompson. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: This project builds on established design principles, construction practices, and community recreation patterns, while addressing contemporary environmental and cultural issues to bring a new type of garden experience to visitors. Its completion comes at a time when Botanic Gardens worldwide are questioning existing research and recreational paradigms and refocusing anew on messages of landscape conservation and a renewed interest in meaningful visitor engagement. TCL's Garden highlights the tension between the natural landscape and our human impulse to change it. This tension is not eliminated; rather it is the driving creative impulse for exploration, expression and interpretation of the landscape and its flora. This project demonstrates Lethlean's contributions to contemporary public space design that connect to a site's context, its specificity and nuances, to elicit meaning and interpretive experience for the public. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: Australian Garden received the prestigious 'Landscape of the Year' Award at the 2013 World Architecture Festival. It also received the 2014 Australian Institute of Landscape Architecture (AILA) National Excellence Award for Design; the 2013 AILA Victoria Design in Landscape Architecture Award for Excellence; and the 2013 Melbourne Design Awards for Landscape Design - Commercial.

         "BACKGROUND: The K2K design proposal, developed by JMD Design (the practice of Anton James) in collaboration with Hill Thallis, and Bennet and Trimble, won the K2K Urban Design Competition in 2016. The competition was run by Randwick City Council, which invited the world's best architects, planners and urbanists to imagine a sustainable and innovative vision for the future of Kensington and Kingsford Town Centres. CONTRIBUTION: The K2K corridor sits within an ancient landscape and water system that ran from Centennial Park to Botany Bay. The Millstream, the most enduring trace of this system, runs parallel to Doncaster Avenue. Over the past century it has been capped and canalised, its primacy in the landscape superseded by the grand axis of Anzac Parade. The proposal that JMD collaborated on invests in the ancient system and reveals it as a complementary figure to Anzac Parade. Combining enhanced public open space and water management, together these initiatives define a new and highly liveable urban structure. Anzac Parade is reconfigured as a boulevard punctuated by new civic places of intensity, whilst the revealed Millstream is reconfigured as a new green spine punctuated by a variety of water bodies within their associated parks. SIGNIFICANCE: This proposal was 1 of 4 finalists where the public was invited to provide feedback; this was a significant move to better understand the community's needs and aspirations. The independent expert jury consisted of Malcolm Snow, Ben Hewett, Jennifer Neales, Kerry Clare and Tim Greer, who unanimously chose JMD, Hill Thalis + Bennett and Trimble as the winner for its diverse range of public benefits, including identification of more public spaces and the integration of light rail, roads and pedestrian access. Randwick City Council awarded the winners $300,000 and published the proposal and consultation report on the Council website. The proposal was reviewed in Architecture Australia and Foreground.",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Hamer Hall is Melbourne's main concert hall. It is a 1982 heritage-listed building by architect Sir Roy Grounds, with interiors by John Truscott. The building's redevelopment by ARM in 2012 repaired its performance acoustics to world standards, and installed state-of-the-art stage technology and back-of-house facilities. It is an outstanding heritage response to an important civic and heritage place of architectural, social and cultural significance. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: ARM's underlying task was to repair Hamer Hall's standing as a major civic building and make it a 21st-century venue. The building represents two artistic discourses in Melbourne: the architectural story of the castle and the mine: the theatrical story of the palace and the cave of jewels. ARM reinterpreted these narratives and added their voice to the story of Hamer Hall. According to jury citation, the sophistication of the design proposition and its execution allowed an approach which restores and celebrates the works of both Grounds and Truscott, adding a third voice that challenges and plays with its predecessors with wit and exuberance. This project exemplifies ARM's radical contribution to the dissemination of ideas and development of an acute, experimental and critical architectural culture in Melbourne and, more broadly, Australia. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project won multiple awards at the 2013 Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) National Awards: the Lachlan Macquarie Award - Heritage Architecture; Marion Mahony Award - Interior Design; National Commendation - Public Architecture; and National Commendation - Urban Design. At the 2013 AIA VIC Chapter Awards, it won: Public Architecture Award - Alterations & Additions; and John George Knight Award - Heritage Architecture.

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: The project was a submission for a 2008 open competition for the masterplan and architectural design of a new cultural precinct in Bodo, Norway. The design was completed through my practice Index Architecture - currently re-named NAAU. The project researches the use of generative and digital design tools in the creation of integrated urban architectural precincts. The project builds upon the work of, amongst others Foreign Office Architects & LAB architecture studio, examining the use of digital design tools and versioning techniques in coupling architectural scale projects with urban infrastructure. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION The design explores generative approaches in design, specifically generative tracing as a technique of 'versioning' the city. Generative tracing is understood as an erosive operation that effectively creates a new network of urban pathways and waterfront settlements. Architectural form is organised around this network, with the programmatic requirements of a new cultural precinct compressed, expanded and re-arranged to address a broader urban agenda. The project posititions urban design as being part of an extended evolutionary process in which a city is engaged. The design contributes a series of techniques for generating new versions of a city - specifically through a porous water front edge condition. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project has been published an exhibited in numerous locations. The project was first published in the book 'Idea Design: Evolving Architecture' (A&C Publishing, Seoul, Korea 2013) ISBN: 978-8972121442 along with a number of other significant international practices. In 2016 it was invited for exhibition the 'Sino-Australian Dialogue on Design Practice Research,' and published in the catalogue ISBN: 978-0-7340-5260-5.

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: The Geelong Library and Heritage Centre is a $45-million, eight-level building designed by Ashton Raggatt McDougall (ARM). The futuristic dome-like structure of building is exemplary of the radical architecture of ARM, which has received numerous significant awards. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Through this project, ARM aimed to celebrate the tradition of great libraries, create an ambitious, future-oriented building, and design an organic structure that lets the natural world penetrate the interior. The building inhabits both the past and the future. Its form pays homage to the ideals of self-improvement, knowledge and curiosity expressed in the domes of great reading rooms such as the State Library of Victoria. It also recalls an era of great civic gestures of the 19th century - a time when domes on public buildings represented democracy, enlightenment and the arrival of civil society.

At the 2016 AIA VIC Chapter Awards, it won the William Wardell Award for Public Architecture; the Marion Mahony Award for Interior Architecture; the Victorian Architecture Medal; and the Regional Prize. Jury Chair Hamish Lyon stated that the building has 'elevated the role of public architecture for both Geelong and the wider regional community.' It was critically reviewed in Architecture Australia, The Design Files, The Age, and Architecture and Design. This project demonstrates the significance of ARM's practice which, in 2016, was awarded the Gold Medal - the highest award of the AIA to recognise distinguished service by Australian architects. According to Naomi Stead, few practices in the country could claim such a commitment to ideas in architecture - to speculation and proposition, to criticism and argument, to a swarming multitude of concepts in every design.",

It was decided that the design should be at once simple and raw, that it would exploit the potential of the existing building and leave nothing to waste. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION The as-found condition of the space of the old department store was strong and stripped back, with four-metre high concrete ceilings, a very deep plan, and a series of large civic-scale windows overlooking Swanston and Bourke Streets. The new plan establishes an even field of workstations for the required eighty people. The aim was to clarify something about the nature of the space, and to touch as little as possible of its existing condition. Everyone is seated to be aligned with one of the large windows, which means they are also aligned with the structural bay and exposed beams above. This simple meter means that desks are a bit further apart than normal, providing many small gaps where one can walk. The field of desks is interrupted by smaller enclosed rooms, allowing project teams to naturally ebb and flow around them as projects grow and shrink. A line of drawing tables hung from existing window sills provides a private thinking surface, withdrawn from the main space of work. The tables put into focus the window itself, the scale of the window in the city, and the relationship between individual activity and the collective group of eighty.

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND The project was an invited design competition commissioned by VicRoads for a pedestrian bridge across a highway on Melbourne's urban fringe. Its purpose was to reconnect a severed historical rail and horse trail, and to mark a civic presence along that highway as an entry to metropolitan Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION This design for a bridge asks two questions; first: how can objects of infrastructure be integrated into their physical environment? Second: how can that object activate an interior akin to architectural space? The design unites research fields of architectural design, landscape architecture, urbanism, and engineering. Works of this type often suffer from their hybridity. In contrast, this design brings a consideration of architectural space to a program that is often treated like a road. The project's enveloping mesh skin aimed to capture a relationship with the trees and topography of its surrounding, while also providing a degree of enclosure that could encourage inhabitation. It reconciles the pragmatic infrastructure with a sculptural response to landscape. In turn, this aims to contribute a built civic presence to the environment. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE The project won an Honourable Mention in the 2007 Architecture Australia Unbuilt Prize. Subsequently the project was reworked and exhibited in the Australian Pavilion at the 2008 Venice Architecture Biennale.

         "BACKGROUND Conland's curatorial objective of exploring ideas of adventure and 'risk' in art today became the question: How do we utilise adventure and what level of risk do we allow for? CONTRIBUTION Kosloff's research centres on how movement, gesture and abstraction translate into significance. Like Mike Parr's rolling camera, Kosloff also films as if the camera were a moving figure (John Hurrell Eye Contact Mar 2010). For her site-specific video installations with Super 8 as a medium for all 3 works Kosloff exploits its capacity for articulating a particular pace and movement in monochrome removing the specificity of time and place (You wonder if these people are still alive now, but of course probably they are, very much so Hurrell. She instead draws attention to how the individual agency is physically expressed in relation to architecture. Stock Exchange, 1998, presents a carefully framed simple panning shot of the exterior horizontal and vertical planes of Melbourne's stock exchange building. Free from grounded bodies and the orienting tasks of vision, the lens provides a new appraisal of what is moving in front of us. In Trapeze, 2009, and St. Kilda Road, 2010, the culture of the city's spectacle is captured in short clips of urban gymnasts. In these city contexts, we see a select social unfolding that pairs the discipline of training (or ritualised movement) with the poetics of the human body.

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: The Wanangkura Stadium is Port Hedland's new multi-purpose recreational centre. The name for the centre means 'whirlwind' in the local Kariyarra language, and pays tribute to the centre's design, which architect Sophie Cleland likened to a cyclonic pattern, creating a 'shimmering, rippling effect on an otherwise flat landscape'. Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett called the Centre '... a spectacular piece of architecture that will become a landmark for Hedland'. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: ARM designed the building as a mirage; using a 'halftone' pixelated technique, the buildings entry facade acts as a clear visual image from long distances, whilst being highly agitated on closer inspection. The building looks different depending on the weather and the time of day: sometimes it blends with the sky, sometimes it stands out against the red dust. Despite the restrictions of location, climate and budget, ARM managed to create an 'iconic' building with lateral thinking and innovation. The Stadium is an important litmus test for the basic value of civic architecture and how to design for, and with, the local condition. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: This project received the prestigious Victorian Architecture Medal at the 2015 Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) VIC Chapter Awards. It featured in: the Autumn 2016 issue of 'The Architect' (the official journal of the AIA WA Chapter); Architecture Australia, Architectural Review Asia Pacific (cover story); ArchDaily; and designboom, amongst others. This project demonstrates the significance of ARM's practice which, in 2016, was awarded the Gold Medal - the highest award of the AIA to recognise distinguished service by Australian architects. According to Naomi Stead, few practices in the country could claim such a commitment to ideas in architecture - to speculation and proposition, to criticism and argument, to a swarming multitude of concepts in every design.",

         "Grace Park House",
         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Grace Park House is an ambitious but sensitive large-scale extension and renovation of an ornate heritage-listed Federation (1890-1915) home in the inner eastern Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. Heritage restrictions forced a careful consideration of the rear façade and its appearance from the street. In response, Iredale Pedersen Hook (IPH) slipped the large-scale addition under the steep pitch of the roof of the host building, creating a dialogue between the old hip roof form and the required volume of the addition. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The extension creates a family home with two faces: the demure, front façade and the dynamic rear elevation clad in copper. The expansive extension rises, stealthily, from beneath the terracotta tiles of the original roof and it shifts and distorts beneath the existing structure. The front rooms of the house were restored and a continuity between the two spaces was achieved by the use of marble, waxed recycled timber, copper and bluestone against a neutral colour palette. The project also continues the studio's investigation of the collective upgrading of environmental performance of existing suburbs through the incremental changes made to existing building stock. Here substantial insulation, a large solar array, massive water tank installed in parallel with the swimming pool and an integrated approach to all services sits alongside less technological 'green' innovations such as recycled timber, water-saving fixtures and natural wax finishes. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The significance of this project is demonstrated by its publication in HOUSES Magazine 76 (Leon van Schaik, 'Grace Darling House', 1 Oct 2010) and in Shanghai Shifu Media's Z-Mag (2011/04, pp. 124-127) and by its inclusion in the international group show, Architectural Urbanism: Melbourne/Seoul at Korean National University of Arts. IPH was one of five Melbourne firms invited to participate.",

         "Central Institute of TAFE Northbridge Campus",
         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Commissioned by the Western Australia Department of Education, the Central Institute of TAFE (CIT) is a $45M training facility for Architecture, Engineering and Beauty students. Lyons, in association with Perth architectural company T&Z, won the commission for this project through a limited design competition sponsored by CIT. The competition was judged by CIT Senior Executive and Geoffrey London, the WA Government Architect at that time.The building provides 12,000m2 gross floor area over 4 levels inclusive of flexible teaching spaces, 2 lecture theatres, a central precinct library, staff office facilities and a large urban foyer named the 'Social Heart' that will become a focal point for CIT's exhibitions and events. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The CIT building has been designed to become the centrepiece of the city's training precinct. It also further advances the establishment of the Knowledge Industry Precinct at Northbridge and the development of the campus as a unified and vibrant urban entity linked directly to Perth's civic heart. This project builds on Lyon's expertise in designing outstanding educational buildings that encourage collaborative learning, work that Nigel Westbrook describes as 'essential to understanding Australia's architecural culture'. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The projec received Commendation for Public Architecture at the 2012 Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) Western Australia Chapter Awards. AIA awards are the most prestigious in the design and construction industry in Australia, vital to public and peer recognition of outstanding contributions in the fields of architecture and the built environment. It is peer reviewed in the professional journal Architecture Australia, 100 (4) (July 2011); Dezeen (April 2011); Australian Design Review (April 2011); and eVolo (US) Architecture magazine (April 2011). The building was listed as an 'iconic' destination in Perth during the Open House 2013 program.",
