      " BACKGROUND: 'Architectural Urbanism: Melbourne/Seoul' was a two-city exhibition funded by RMIT University and the Korean National University, supported by the Australian Government through the Australian International Cultural Council. Kerstin Thompson Architecture (KTA) showed five works - Carrum Downs Police Station, MUMA Gallery, Lake Conneware House, Napier Street Housing and Royal Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre - as one of ten architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected to exhibit. The exhibited work included large scale photographs, working drawings and exegetical text. CONTRIBUTION: The exhibition explored architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. Within this context, the public projects exhibited by KTA explore relationships between interior and exterior, building and street, and the existing and the new. This draws on Thompson's ongoing practice and design research focussing on architecture as a civic endeavour, forging connections between buildings, their surroundings and the people who inhabit them. SIGNIFICANCE: 'Architectural Urbanism' was an international, cross institutional exhibition that received external funding, evidencing significance for the selected works by the 10 participating practices. In Seoul, the exhibition was opened by the deputy Australian Ambassador. The Melbourne exhibition was reviewed in Architecture Australia (AA). These KTA projects have also received multiple awards and media attention including four AIA (Australian Institute of Architects) Victorian Architecture Awards, an IDEA (Interior Design Excellence Awards) award, three book features, critical reviews in AA, and articles in SMH, The Australian, Broadsheet and Archdaily.\n",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Court House, George+Murphy House, Fitzroy Community School Creative Space and Rose House are 4 exemplar works of Baracco + Wright Architects, spanning over a diverse range of locations from inner urban areas to sensitive rural and coastal environments. These projects were selected for exhibition in the reciprocal international Seoul/Melbourne exhibition, 'Architectural Urbanism'. Baracco + Wright was one of ten young architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected for inclusion in the event. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Exhibition curator Melanie Dodd said 'Architectural Urbanism' would explore architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. The 4 selected works by B+W exemplify this approach, by sharing common ground which transcends their formal differences because of how they play with the threshold and boundaries of urban site conditions as a means to reinterpret the ordinary. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The Court House was the only one of these 4 works not previously published. The selection of these projects as examples of 'architectural urbanism' inserts this body of work into broader intercultural conversation. The exhibition was funded by RMIT and the Korean National University. The project received external support from the Australian Government through the Australian International Cultural Council: an initiative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The exhibition was opened by the deputy Australian Ambassador in Seoul. A reciprocal exhibition, co-curated by Jong-Kyu Kim, was subsequently held at RMIT's Design Hub.",

         "Grace Park House",
         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Grace Park House is an ambitious but sensitive large-scale extension and renovation of an ornate heritage-listed Federation (1890-1915) home in the inner eastern Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. Heritage restrictions forced a careful consideration of the rear façade and its appearance from the street. In response, Iredale Pedersen Hook (IPH) slipped the large-scale addition under the steep pitch of the roof of the host building, creating a dialogue between the old hip roof form and the required volume of the addition. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The extension creates a family home with two faces: the demure, front façade and the dynamic rear elevation clad in copper. The expansive extension rises, stealthily, from beneath the terracotta tiles of the original roof and it shifts and distorts beneath the existing structure. The front rooms of the house were restored and a continuity between the two spaces was achieved by the use of marble, waxed recycled timber, copper and bluestone against a neutral colour palette. The project also continues the studio's investigation of the collective upgrading of environmental performance of existing suburbs through the incremental changes made to existing building stock. Here substantial insulation, a large solar array, massive water tank installed in parallel with the swimming pool and an integrated approach to all services sits alongside less technological 'green' innovations such as recycled timber, water-saving fixtures and natural wax finishes. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The significance of this project is demonstrated by its publication in HOUSES Magazine 76 (Leon van Schaik, 'Grace Darling House', 1 Oct 2010) and in Shanghai Shifu Media's Z-Mag (2011/04, pp. 124-127) and by its inclusion in the international group show, Architectural Urbanism: Melbourne/Seoul at Korean National University of Arts.

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Urban Box was one of 4 projects by Iredale Pedersen Hook (IPH) selected for exhibition in the reciprocal international Seoul/Melbourne exhibition, 'Architectural Urbanism' (the others were Sheep House, Grace Park House and Innocent Bystander winery). IPH was one of 10 firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) who participated. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Urban Box is a solid little building in Port Melbourne, an inner-city Melbourne suburb of single-fronted timber Victorian workers cottages, high-rise apartments, public housing and light industry. It is the prototype of a collection of small houses by IPH that uses the insulated concrete sandwich precast panel system, Thermomass. The site is 99m2; the subdivision of an already small piece of land. The house shifts the typology of infill housing towards a responsive and sustainable approach with a sense of material quality. Programmed 'upside-down', the bedrooms and bathrooms are on the ground floor and the living spaces and primary outdoor space upstairs. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: Urban Box was published in Australian Home Beautiful in Feb 2012. Its selection for inclusion in this international event inserts the project into broader intercultural conversation. The exhibition was funded by RMIT and the Korean National University. The project received external support from the Australian Government through the Australian International Cultural Council: an initiative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

         "Geelong Library and Heritage Centre",
         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: The Geelong Library and Heritage Centre is a $45-million, eight-level building designed by Ashton Raggatt McDougall (ARM). The futuristic dome-like structure of building is exemplary of the radical architecture of ARM, which has received numerous significant awards. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Through this project, ARM aimed to celebrate the tradition of great libraries, create an ambitious, future-oriented building, and design an organic structure that lets the natural world penetrate the interior. The building inhabits both the past and the future. Its form pays homage to the ideals of self-improvement, knowledge and curiosity expressed in the domes of great reading rooms such as the State Library of Victoria. It also recalls an era of great civic gestures of the 19th century - a time when domes on public buildings represented democracy, enlightenment and the arrival of civil society. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project won Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture at the 2016 Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) National Awards. At the 2016 AIA VIC Chapter Awards, it won the William Wardell Award for Public Architecture; the Marion Mahony Award for Interior Architecture; the Victorian Architecture Medal; and the Regional Prize. Jury Chair Hamish Lyon stated that the building has 'elevated the role of public architecture for both Geelong and the wider regional community.' It was critically reviewed in Architecture Australia, The Design Files, The Age, and Architecture and Design. This project demonstrates the significance of ARM's practice which, in 2016, was awarded the Gold Medal - the highest award of the AIA to recognise distinguished service by Australian architects. According to Naomi Stead, few practices in the country could claim such a commitment to ideas in architecture - to speculation and proposition, to criticism and argument, to a swarming multitude of concepts in every design.",
