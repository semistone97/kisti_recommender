         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Grace Park House is an ambitious but sensitive large-scale extension and renovation of an ornate heritage-listed Federation (1890-1915) home in the inner eastern Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn. Heritage restrictions forced a careful consideration of the rear façade and its appearance from the street. In response, Iredale Pedersen Hook (IPH) slipped the large-scale addition under the steep pitch of the roof of the host building, creating a dialogue between the old hip roof form and the required volume of the addition. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The extension creates a family home with two faces: the demure, front façade and the dynamic rear elevation clad in copper. The expansive extension rises, stealthily, from beneath the terracotta tiles of the original roof and it shifts and distorts beneath the existing structure. The front rooms of the house were restored and a continuity between the two spaces was achieved by the use of marble, waxed recycled timber, copper and bluestone against a neutral colour palette. The project also continues the studio's investigation of the collective upgrading of environmental performance of existing suburbs through the incremental changes made to existing building stock. Here substantial insulation, a large solar array, massive water tank installed in parallel with the swimming pool and an integrated approach to all services sits alongside less technological 'green' innovations such as recycled timber, water-saving fixtures and natural wax finishes. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The significance of this project is demonstrated by its publication in HOUSES Magazine 76 (Leon van Schaik, 'Grace Darling House', 1 Oct 2010) and in Shanghai Shifu Media's Z-Mag (2011/04, pp. 124-127) and by its inclusion in the international group show, Architectural Urbanism: Melbourne/Seoul at Korean National University of Arts. IPH was one of five Melbourne firms invited to participate.",

         "BACKGROUND: 'Architectural Urbanism: Melbourne/Seoul' was a two-city exhibition funded by RMIT University and the Korean National University, supported by the Australian Government through the Australian International Cultural Council. Kerstin Thompson Architecture (KTA) showed five works - Carrum Downs Police Station, MUMA Gallery, Lake Conneware House, Napier Street Housing and Royal Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre - as one of ten architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected to exhibit. The exhibited work included large scale photographs, working drawings and exegetical text. CONTRIBUTION: The exhibition explored architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. Within this context, the public projects exhibited by KTA explore relationships between interior and exterior, building and street, and the existing and the new. This draws on Thompson's ongoing practice and design research focussing on architecture as a civic endeavour, forging connections between buildings, their surroundings and the people who inhabit them. SIGNIFICANCE: 'Architectural Urbanism' was an international, cross institutional exhibition that received external funding, evidencing significance for the selected works by the 10 participating practices. In Seoul, the exhibition was opened by the deputy Australian Ambassador. The Melbourne exhibition was reviewed in Architecture Australia (AA). These KTA projects have also received multiple awards and media attention including four AIA (Australian Institute of Architects) Victorian Architecture Awards, an IDEA (Interior Design Excellence Awards) award, three book features, critical reviews in AA, and articles in SMH, The Australian, Broadsheet and Archdaily.",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Hamer Hall is Melbourne's main concert hall. It is a 1982 heritage-listed building by architect Sir Roy Grounds, with interiors by John Truscott. The building's redevelopment by ARM in 2012 repaired its performance acoustics to world standards, and installed state-of-the-art stage technology and back-of-house facilities. It is an outstanding heritage response to an important civic and heritage place of architectural, social and cultural significance. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: ARM's underlying task was to repair Hamer Hall's standing as a major civic building and make it a 21st-century venue. The building represents two artistic discourses in Melbourne: the architectural story of the castle and the mine: the theatrical story of the palace and the cave of jewels. ARM reinterpreted these narratives and added their voice to the story of Hamer Hall. According to jury citation, the sophistication of the design proposition and its execution allowed an approach which restores and celebrates the works of both Grounds and Truscott, adding a third voice that challenges and plays with its predecessors with wit and exuberance. This project exemplifies ARM's radical contribution to the dissemination of ideas and development of an acute, experimental and critical architectural culture in Melbourne and, more broadly, Australia. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project won multiple awards at the 2013 Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) National Awards: the Lachlan Macquarie Award - Heritage Architecture; Marion Mahony Award - Interior Design; National Commendation - Public Architecture; and National Commendation - Urban Design. At the 2013 AIA VIC Chapter Awards, it won: Public Architecture Award - Alterations & Additions; and John George Knight Award - Heritage Architecture. This demonstrates the significance of ARM's practice which, in 2016, was awarded the Gold Medal - the highest award of the AIA to recognise distinguished service by Australian architects.",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: The Geelong Library and Heritage Centre is a $45-million, eight-level building designed by Ashton Raggatt McDougall (ARM). The futuristic dome-like structure of building is exemplary of the radical architecture of ARM, which has received numerous significant awards. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Through this project, ARM aimed to celebrate the tradition of great libraries, create an ambitious, future-oriented building, and design an organic structure that lets the natural world penetrate the interior. The building inhabits both the past and the future. Its form pays homage to the ideals of self-improvement, knowledge and curiosity expressed in the domes of great reading rooms such as the State Library of Victoria. It also recalls an era of great civic gestures of the 19th century - a time when domes on public buildings represented democracy, enlightenment and the arrival of civil society. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project won Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture at the 2016 Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) National Awards. At the 2016 AIA VIC Chapter Awards, it won the William Wardell Award for Public Architecture; the Marion Mahony Award for Interior Architecture; the Victorian Architecture Medal; and the Regional Prize. Jury Chair Hamish Lyon stated that the building has 'elevated the role of public architecture for both Geelong and the wider regional community.' It was critically reviewed in Architecture Australia, The Design Files, The Age, and Architecture and Design. This project demonstrates the significance of ARM's practice which, in 2016, was awarded the Gold Medal - the highest award of the AIA to recognise distinguished service by Australian architects. According to Naomi Stead, few practices in the country could claim such a commitment to ideas in architecture - to speculation and proposition, to criticism and argument, to a swarming multitude of concepts in every design.",

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Paul Carter's Material Thinking design studio was part of an interdisciplinary team of architects (Lyons), landscape architects (Rush-Wright) who created a new public square for central Dandenong. The square is part of the $290 million Revitalising Central Dandenong project. It opened in March 2014. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: 'Alterations', the ground pattern for the new Civic Square is a translation of topographical, clothing and locally-sourced patterns into a design that reconfigures the local ground as a giant body in motion or choreography. The name refers to the work of local tailors. The project develops and extends Paul Carter's research on how to historicise public space. Beginning with Federation Square (2002) Carter has worked on several projects in which inscriptions reveal the poetic, cultural and material aspects of sites. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The Dandenong plaza won the Australian Institute of Architects (AILA) Victorian chapter Design in Landscape Archicture, Excellence Award. The judges said: 'This remarkable project completed under the Revitalising Central Dandenong urban renewal initiative offers a public square that is truly civic in nature, providing for gatherings, events, diversity, arts and culture. The space could have easily been dominated by the neo brutalist architecture of the Lyons-designed Dandenong Civic Centre and Library adjacent, however the fine grain of its paving design and splashes of intense colour give the square a strong presence that is at once warm and welcoming. The paving motif, done in collaboration with Material Thinking, was created from fabric patterns found around Dandenong and enriches the design with cultural narrative and meaning.'.",
