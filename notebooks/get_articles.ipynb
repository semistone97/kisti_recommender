      "It is necessary to have a model that describes the feature of the knee Joint with a sufficient accuracy. Koreans, however, do not have their own knee joint model to be used in the total knee replacement arthroplasty. They have to use European or American models which do not match Koreans. Three-dimensional visualization techniques are found to be useful in a wide range of medical applications. Three-dimensional imaging studies such as CT(computed tomography) and MRI(magnetic resonance image) provide the primary source of patient-specific data. Three-dimensional knee joint models were constructed by image processing of the CT data of 10 subjects. Using the constructed model, the dimensions of Korean knee joint were measured. And this study proposed a three-dimensional model and data, which can be helpful to develop Korean knee implants and to analyze knee joint movements.\n"

         "<P>Purpose<P>The aim of this article is to develop an architectural pedagogy for the Anthropocene. The author reflect on a project within a postgraduate architectural theory module to address the following questions: How can architectural pedagogy articulate critical modes of production that contribute to quality education in the time of the Anthropocene? What are the ideas, values and practices needed?</P></P><P>Design/methodology/approach<P>The method employed is close reading of texts focussed on three areas: critical theory and pedagogy, political theory and the Anthropocene, and architectural theory and typological urbanism. These theoretical narratives are placed in dialogue with a reflection on a design research pedagogical project. The theoretical narratives and design research project seek to articulate the multidimensionality of critical education. The methodology enacted in the paper performs the pedagogy of the classroom.</P></P><P>Findings<P>The study yields compelling conclusions regarding the potential for rethinking the idea of typology under the pressure of the Anthropocene and of critical pedagogy combined with design research to take positions on urgent political and social matters. The author concludes with a toolkit of concepts, values and knowledge practices.</P></P><P>Originality/value<P>At a time when disciplines tend towards discrete specialisation, while the need for knowledge production is ever more transdisciplinary, this paper develops inventive techniques and conceptual frameworks for supporting approaches where different fields and ideas make contact as a collective task in the era of the Anthropocene. It updates theories of typology to address contemporary pressures.</P></P>",

         "<▼1><P><B>Abstract</B><P>The form and organization of urban architecture is examined at the central Mexico site of Xochicalco to reconstruct aspects of both its internal community structure and regional political organization during the Epiclassic period (A.D. 700-900). Analysis of the site's defensive architecture provides unique information about the city's internal design. Dry moats, walled roads, and steep terrace facades subdivide the community into a series of population segments that on the basis of both size and architecture type resemble ward divisions found in central Mexico cities at the time of Conquest. Furthermore, Xochicalco does not have a single defensive perimeter characteristic of a strongly centralized polity; instead, it possesses a series of defensive precincts located on the hills and ridges adjacent to Cerro Xochicalco that are equivalent in form and redundant in function. The model that best approximates the segmentary nature of this structure is that of a regional confederacy dominated by Xochicalco during the Epiclassic.</P></P></▼1><▼2><P><B>RESUMEN</B><P>Este estudio presenta un resumen del dise&ntilde;o y la organizati&oacute;n arquitect&oacute;nica en la ciudad de Xochicalco, Morelos, en el altiplano central de M&eacute;xico durante el epicl&aacute;sico (700-900 d.C). El prop&oacute;sito de este an&aacute;lisis es la identificati&oacute;n de la estructura social interna de la comumdad urbana y el papel que ten&iacute;a en el sistema pol&iacute;tica en el occidente de Morelos. El estudio se basa en un an&aacute;lisis arquitect&oacute;nico, el cual proporciona datos muy informativos sobre el plan defensivo y su impacto sobre el dise&ntilde;o urbano. El sitio est&aacute; dividido por fosos defensivos, calzadas amurralladas y las fachadas de terrazas grandes en una serie de unidades las cuales, por medio del tama&ntilde;o de su poblaci&oacute;n y el tipo de arquitectura ceremonial, representan un nivel de organizati&oacute;n parecido a los barrios reportados en las ciudades del altiplano en el momento de la Conquista. Tambi&eacute;n en Xochicalco se encuentran conjuntos m&uacute;ltiples e independientes que fueron construidos con sus defensas propias. Esto es interesante porque suguiere que el sistema politico est&aacute; caracterizado por una organizati&oacute;n segmentaria y no centralizada. Es muy posible que la organizati&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica que produjo este patr&oacute;n arquitect&oacute;nico fuera una confederati&oacute;n de comunidades bajo el dominio de Xochicalco durante el epicl&aacute;sico.</P></P></▼2>",

         "Effects of heat waves on urban warming across different urban morphologies and climate zones",
         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Heat wave (HW) periods, which are characterized by unusual high temperatures and heat stress, are known as one of the global issues that negatively affect the land and atmosphere, especially in urban areas. Higher urbanization rates in cities may result in high temperature warming, which is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Recently, researchers have revealed pronounced effects based on HW and UHI interactions; however, studies that linked their effects with surface energy fluxes in different urban landscape and climate are still inadequate. This study utilized the Community Land Model (CLM) to assess the effect of HW towards UHI, while considering energy fluxes variations in Seoul, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and Melbourne, with different climate influences and urban morphologies. Generally, Seoul and Tokyo showed intense HW magnitude from 2000 to 2018 based on the HW indices. The surface energy flux components demonstrated a distinct pattern especially from 11:00 to 17:00, with the exception of sensible heat in Melbourne. Further energy-flux partitioning revealed that changes in the heat storage ratio were most significant in Seoul, with 1.39 partitioning due to its larger impervious area. A smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio of open mid-rise building has enhanced urban warming in Melbourne, whereas smaller impervious and larger pervious road fraction could mitigate urban warming effects in Kuala Lumpur. Seoul showed the highest changes in daytime UHI under HW at 2.01 &deg;C, due to the low convection efficiency in compact high-rise building, while nighttime UHI was highly influenced by heat storage and anthropogenic heat release.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Seoul and Tokyo have more intense heat waves (HWs) during 2000&ndash;2018. </LI> <LI>  Latent heat, heat storage, and net radiation changed consistently from 11:00 to 17:00 during HW events. </LI> <LI>  City that has compact building type contributed to the highest heat storage ratio. </LI> <LI>  Smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio enhanced urban warming under HWs. </LI> <LI>  Urban heat island was enhanced under HW occurrences. </LI> </UL> </P>",

Here, we describe the implementation of our BCI speech synthesis system, which can be trained with a limited amount of overt speech to produce a continuous stream of audio outputs during subsequent speech imagery tasks. We evaluate (1) the effect of parameter choices on the execution time of individual operations in the BCI loop and (2) the accuracy of predicted outputs. To confirm the feasibility of our approach, we conduct simulations in a pseudo-prospective fashion using recorded datasets from five patients undergoing intracranial epilepsy monitoring. We propose that our system can be used to synthesize different types of speech under specific clinical constraints.</P>",

         "This paper begins by situating the large screen in Melbourne as part of the industrial cluster development of the Southbank cultural precinct. It examines urban regeneration and cultural policies to map the politics of its spatial geography of agglomeration. It further explores the role of networked screen in the formation of a transnational creative cluster. Using a telematic large screen event staged across Melbourne and Seoul, the paper evaluates the responses of audiences to examine the politics of cultural and civic engagement. While scholarships on creative clusters predominantly focus on the new value chain of industrial and commercial production that arises as a result of agglomeration, this paper argues that the large screen possesses the capacity not only to invigorate public participation, but as a transnational creative cluster, the networked large screen also possesses the potential to enhance the quality of intercultural communication between Asia and Australia.",

         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P><P>A 12 month study of urban concentrations of total suspended particulates (TSP) and 20 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was carried out in Seoul (South Korea), Hong Kong, Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia) and Melbourne (Australia). Concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere varied widely between the cities over the course of the study, ranging from a low of 24.1&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Melbourne during the winter to a high of 376.2&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Jakarta during the dry season. Seasonal variations in both TSP and PAH were observed in the tropical cities in the study with higher concentrations during the dry season and lower concentrations during the wet season. TSP and PAH concentrations are correlated with each other in these cities, suggesting that they have related sources and sinks for these cities. In the temperate cities of Melbourne and Seoul, PAH concentrations were higher during the cold winter season and lower during the warm summer. However, TSP was quite variable over the years in these latter cities and no clear seasonal trend was observed. A number of factors have been investigated which could be contributing to seasonal variations in pollutant levels. In the temperate climates, increased emissions due to the use of fossil fuels for heating in the winter is evident. However, an interrogation of the database with respect to the other factors such as (1)increased photolytic degradation during the summer, (2)transport of pollutants from other sources, (3)removal of PAH via wet deposition and in-cloud scavenging mechanisms and (4)volatilisation of lower molecular weight species during periods of high temperature indicates the importance of multiple processes. Even though there are clearly much lower levels of both particulates and PAH in the wet season of the tropical climates, no statistically significant correlations have been observed between rainfall levels and pollutant concentrations.</P>",

         "<P>It is a challenge to design a movie recommendation system with artificial intelligent technology. It is difficult to get satisfactory results as not all data is reliable and valuable from the internet. To solve this problem, researchers recommend using a recommendation system which presents relevant information instead of searching the same information multiple times. Generally, collaborative filtering methods based on user information (such as gender type, geographical area, or preference) are effective. However, in today&#x2019;s era, everyone is concerned about suggestions or guidelines so that he/she can make the decision, our area of research includes movies recommendation system by which we can provide the list of similar movies to the user. Now the user is assisted with some lists of movies recommended to the user by our model, he/she only has to decide which movie he should watch next. Instead of looking into the whole list it&#x2019;s better to have some recommendations based on which he/she can decide easily. The overall performance for the purposed framework resulted in an accuracy of 66% which is good for such initiative.</P>",

         "<P><B>Abstract</B><P>Background:<P>Narmafotinib is a highly potent and selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase over-expressed in pancreatic cancer, where it contributes to cell survival, proliferation, migration and chemoresistance and thus plays a key role in tumour growth. FAK also contributes to multiple mechanisms underlying fibrosis and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. A Phase 1b/2a trial - the ACCENT trial - investigates narmafotinib in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in advanced pancreatic cancer patients; Phase 1b is complete, with Phase 2a currently underway in Australia and South Korea.</P></P><P>Methods:<P>The ACCENT trial (NCT05355298) is an open-label two-part study of the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability, and efficacy of narmafotinib in combination with standard gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) as first-line therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients received narmafotinib as monotherapy on days -8 to -2 and then again as 4-day pulses beginning on days 3, 10 and 24 of each 28-day chemotherapy cycle. In Part A, patients were enrolled in a 3+3 combination design with sequentially escalating doses of narmafotinib (100, 200 or 400 mg, qd) to identify a suitable Phase 2 dose. Narmafotinib plasma PK was assessed during monotherapy and Cycle 1. Imaging was conducted every 2 months and evaluated using RECIST 1.1. Part B utilizes a Simon&rsquo;s two-stage design at 400 mg narmafotinib, with the primary objectives of assessing safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination.</P></P><P>Results:<P>Preliminary Phase 1b (Part A) analysis across all doses (14 patients) showed narmafotinib to be generally safe and well-tolerated with promising signs of efficacy indicating a dose-dependent increase in duration of treatment and best response. Five confirmed partial responses (4 at 400 mg narmafotinib; 1 at 200 mg) were recorded and 4/6 patients on 400 mg narmafotinib received treatment for >6 months. A dose of 400 mg qd of narmafotinib was selected for the Phase 2a (Part B) study. Preliminary Part B analysis from the initial 26 patients showed narmafotinib to be generally safe and well-tolerated with promising signs of efficacy, with 10 confirmed partial responses observed to date. The median duration on trial (DoT) continues to demonstrate a significant improvement over the historical gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel combination. Narmafotinib continues to be well-tolerated. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were predominately mild to moderate and included nausea (20.5%), diarrhea (12.8%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (10.3%).</P></P><P>Conclusions:<P>Preliminary Part B analysis on the initial 26 patients showed narmafotinib to be safe and well-tolerated with promising signs of efficacy.</P></P><P>Citation Format:<P>Terrie-Anne Cock, Sarah Kinkel, Nicole Kruger, Charlotte Mulder, Ananda Sumitra, Marion Harris, Warren Joubert, Lara Lipton, Adnan Nagrial, Nick Pavlakis, Jin Won Kim, Choong-kun Lee, Do-Youn Oh, Joon Oh Park, Woo-Jin Lee, Jason Lickliter, Christopher Burns.

         "기술의 발전과 사회구조의 변화는 새로운 소비 형태의 등장에 큰 영향을 주었다. 고객들은 다양하고 새로운 경험을 추구하며 그 범위는 공간으로 확장되었다. 특히, 고객과 가장 밀접한 커뮤니케이션 역할을 하는 공간의 표현은 더욱 빠른 대응이 필요했으며, 과거의 단순 디스플레이와 판매를 넘어선 변화가 필요했다. 흔히 트렌드의 영향을 받는 패션 스토어는 다양한 사조에 의해 표현되며 가장 대표적으로 미니멀리즘 컨셉의 적용을 말할 수 있다. 다양한 사조의 대립이 일어났던 1960년대에 오브제 트루베와의 복합 개념으로 생겨난 미니멀리즘은 꾸준히 조형예술 분야에서 다양한 양상으로 표현되고 있다. 여러 분야에서 진행된 연구들은 미니멀리즘이 동양사상의 영향을 받았을 것으로 추정하며, 이 두 개념이 근본적으로 같은 내용을 담고 있음에도 불구하고 지역의 공간관에 따라 표현의 차이가 존재한다. &amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 본 연구는 동양과 서양이라는 지역적 차이에 따라 나타나는 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘 적용 양상을 분석함으로써, 향후 효과적인 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘 표현 특성 제시에 목적이 있다. 연구 방법으로는 선행연구와 문헌조사를 통해 미니멀리즘의 표현 특성과 스토어 공간 구성 요소를 정리한 다음 인터넷 자료 조사 및 공식 홈페이지를 참고해 사례분석을 진행했다.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 패션 스토어의 공간 구성 요소는 파사드, 벽, 바닥, 기둥, 천장 등 주로 고정적 요소로 구성된 ‘공간요소’, 집기, 소도구, 카운터, 조명 등 단순 디스플레이를 나타내는 ‘진열요소’, VP, PP, IP로 이루어진 ‘연출요소’로 설명할 수 있다. 특히, 2010년대를 기점으로 스토어 구성 요소의 정리에 있어 VMD의 역할을 하는 연출요소의 구분이 이루어졌다. 그리고 미니멀리즘의 특성은 절제되며 단순기하학적 표현의 ‘단순성’, 은유적 의미를 제거한 ‘단일성’, 계층적 관계를 탈피하기 위한 표준 단위의 반복 배열의 ‘반복성’, 물체성을 강조하는 ‘환원성’, 주위환경과 연관해 장소성을 포함하고 있는 ‘환경성’으로 구성된다. 이와 같은 미니멀리즘의 다섯 가지 특성들은 공간에서 적용을 통해 세 가지로 구분할 수 있다. 먼저, 폐쇄성과 확장성을 표현하는 ‘공간적 특성’, 단순성과 반복성의 ‘형태적 특성’, 물성과 비물성을 통한 ‘재료적 특성’으로 이루어진다. &amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 앞서 도출된 내용을 바탕으로 사례분석을 진행했다. 분석대상은 한중일로 한정한 동양의 패션 스토어 11곳과 유럽미국을 중심으로 한 서양의 패션 스토어 13곳, 총 24곳으로 의류 중심의 판매가 이루어지는 패션 스토어 중 디자이너의 인터뷰에서 미니멀리즘 컨셉을 언급하거나 작품 설명에 명시한 작품을 도출했다.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 사례분석 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, 패션 스토어의 공간 구성에 따른 미니멀리즘은 진열요소&amp;lt;고정요소&amp;lt;연출요소의 순서로 나타나며, 미니멀리즘 표현 특성은 공간표현특성&amp;lt;재료표현특성&amp;lt;형태표현특성으로 나타났다. 둘째, 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘은 동·서양의 영향을 받지 않으며, 앞서 분석한 평균과 같은 양상을 보였지만, 공간표현에서의 차이가 발생했다. 같은 컨셉의 적용임에도 불구하고 생기는 공간표현의 차이는 공간관에 의거하며, 동양 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘은 형태와 환경의 어울림을 추구하며 무(無)로 인해 생기는 공간(空間)의 특성으로 동양의 공간관과 무(無)의 개념이 내재되어 있음을 확인할 수 있다. 서양 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘은 단조로운 색채 속 포인트 컬러를 통해 공간을 풍부하게 만들며, 물리적 폐쇄성과 확장성 표현의 공존이 거의 나타나지 않는다. 이처럼 이분법적 사고의 표현으로 객관적 공간을 추구한다. 셋째, 동서양 패션 스토어의 공통 요소로는 단순성과 반복성, 물성의 표현으로 특히, 노출 콘크리트와 스테인리스, 목재 등의 사용을 통해 환원성을 표현한다. 반대로 비물성의 경우 국부적으로 사용하고 있으며, 이와 같은 컨셉의 표현은 연출요소에 의해 많은 영향을 받고있는 것을 확인할 수 있었다.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 따라서 동서양 패션 스토어에 적용된 미니멀리즘 표현은 공간표현의 차이를 보이고 있었으며 직접적 언급이 없음에도 불구하고 지역에 따른 공간관이 내재되어 표현되었다. 본 연구는 패션 스토어에 적용된 동서양의 미니멀리즘 표현 차이를 확인했다는 점에서 의미를 찾을 수 있다. 본 연구를 통해 패션 스토어에서 미니멀리즘의 적용에 있어 더욱 효과적인 방향을 제시할 것이라 예상하며 추후 지역에 따른 정확한 비교를 위한 연구의 진행이 필요할 것으로 판단된다.",

The KTA model incorporates implementation planning that is optimally suited to the information needs of clinicians. The <SMALL>can&#8208;implement</SMALL><SUP>&copy;</SUP> is an evidence implementation process informed by the KTA model. An online counterpart, the <SMALL>can&#8208;implement.pro</SMALL><SUP>&copy;</SUP>, was developed to enable greater dissemination and utilization of the <SMALL>can&#8208;implement</SMALL><SUP>&copy;</SUP> process. The driver for this work was health professionals' need for facilitation that is iterative, informed by context and localized to the specific needs of users. The literature supporting this paper includes evaluation studies and theoretical concepts relevant to KTA model, evidence implementation and facilitation. Nursing and other health disciplines require a skill set and resources to successfully navigate the complexity of organizational requirements, inter&#8208;professional leadership and day&#8208;to&#8208;day practical management to implement evidence into clinical practice. The <SMALL>can&#8208;implement.pro</SMALL><SUP>&copy;</SUP> provides an accessible, inclusive system for evidence implementation projects. There is empirical support for evidence implementation informed by the KTA model, which in this phase of work has been developed for online uptake.

         "<P><B>Background</B></P><P>Conceptual frameworks are recommended as a way of applying theory to enhance implementation efforts. The Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework was developed in Canada by Graham and colleagues in the 2000s, following a review of 31 planned action theories. The framework has two components: Knowledge Creation and an Action Cycle, each of which comprises multiple phases. This review sought to answer two questions: ‘Is the KTA Framework used in practice? And if so, how?’</P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P>This study is a citation analysis and systematic review. The index citation for the original paper was identified on three databases&#x2014;Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar&#x2014;with the facility for citation searching. Limitations of English language and year of publication 2006-June 2013 were set. A taxonomy categorising the continuum of usage was developed. Only studies applying the framework to implementation projects were included. Data were extracted and mapped against each phase of the framework for studies where it was integral to the implementation project.</P><P><B>Results</B></P><P>The citation search yielded 1,787 records. A total of 1,057 titles and abstracts were screened. One hundred and forty-six studies described usage to varying degrees, ranging from referenced to integrated. In ten studies, the KTA Framework was integral to the design, delivery and evaluation of the implementation activities. All ten described using the Action Cycle and seven referred to Knowledge Creation. The KTA Framework was enacted in different health care and academic settings with projects targeted at patients, the public, and nursing and allied health professionals.</P><P><B>Conclusions</B></P><P>The KTA Framework is being used in practice with varying degrees of completeness. It is frequently cited, with usage ranging from simple attribution via a reference, through informing planning, to making an intellectual contribution. When the framework was integral to knowledge translation, it guided action in idiosyncratic ways and there was theory fidelity. Prevailing wisdom encourages the use of theories, models and conceptual frameworks, yet their application is less evident in practice. This may be an artefact of reporting, indicating that prospective, primary research is needed to explore the real value of the KTA Framework and similar tools.</P><P><B>Electronic supplementary material</B></P><P>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13012-014-0172-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</P>",

         "<P><B>Background</B></P><P>Hundreds of nursing professionals graduate each year from Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) programs, entrusted with roles as practice scholars and leaders. Graduates are tasked to lead multidisciplinary knowledge implementation projects to improve safety, quality, and key performance metrics. Nevertheless, there is a continued lack of agreement and faculty dissatisfaction with the format, focus, and results of the DNP graduation projects. The use of a wide range of models and methodologies from different sciences for knowledge implementation introduces challenges to DNP students; affects the scientific rigor of the projects; and results in the overuse, superficial use, or misuse of the models. Quality improvement (QI) and program evaluation studies are substantial investments that may lead to waste and even harm if not well conducted. Traditional QI methodologies, commonly used in DNP projects, were found to be uncertain in improving health care outcomes. The complexity of health care systems calls for cross-fertilization between improvement and implementation sciences to improve health care outcomes.</P><P><B>Objective</B></P><P>This study describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of a hybrid model for QI and program evaluation studies to guide scholarship in the DNP program.</P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P>The hybrid model was based on cross-fertilization between improvement and implementation sciences. The model adapted the Getting to Outcome (GTO) and Knowledge to Action (KTA) models as the overarching process models for knowledge implementation. Within each phase of the GTO and KTA models, expected barriers and facilitators for the implementation and adoption of innovation were identified based on the CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research). Accordingly, strategies to facilitate the implementation and adoption of innovations were identified based on a refined list of implementation strategies and QI tools. The choice of these models was based on the top 5 criteria for selecting implementation science theories and frameworks. Seven DNP students used the hybrid model to conduct QI projects. Students evaluated their experiences by responding to a Qualtrics survey.</P><P><B>Results</B></P><P>The hybrid model encouraged a comprehensive systematic way of thinking, provided tools essential to implementation success, emphasized the need for adaptability in implementation, maintained rigor in QI, and guided the sustainability of change initiatives. Some of the challenges faced by students included finding reliable and valid measures, attaining and maintaining staff buy-in, and competing organizational priorities.</P><P><B>Conclusions</B></P><P>Cross-fertilization between improvement and implementation sciences provided a roadmap and systematic thinking for successful QI projects in the DNP program. The integration of the CFIR with the GTO or KTA process models, enforced by the use of evidence-based implementation strategies and QI tools, reflected the complexity of health care systems and emphasized the need for adaptability in implementation.</P><P><B>International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)</B></P><P>RR1-10.2196/54213</P>",

Criteria weighting and technological importance ranking were determined by means of the Analytic Hierarchy Process as a decision aid, along with hierarchical representation and pairwise comparisons. The opinions derived from three divisions of KTA were analyzed and aggregated. Such aggregated prioritization weighting of technologies allows the corporation management to use it for funding decisions about technological aspects of its long-range planning for R&D projects during the period from 1992 to 2006; especially those concerning baseline budget level selection and the scope of research activities.",

         "A Model for Doctor of Nursing Practice Projects based on a Hybrid Approach of Improvement and Implementation Sciences (Preprint)",
         "<sec>\n                    <title>BACKGROUND</title>\n                        <p>Hundreds of nursing professionals graduate each year from Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) programs, entrusted with roles as practice scholars and leaders. Graduates are tasked to lead multidisciplinary knowledge implementation projects to improve safety, quality, and key performance metrics. Nevertheless, there is a continued lack of agreement and faculty dissatisfaction with the format, focus, and results of the DNP graduation projects. The use of a wide range of models and methodologies from different sciences for knowledge implementation introduces challenges to DNP students; affects the scientific rigor of the projects; and results in the overuse, superficial use, or misuse of the models. Quality improvement (QI) and program evaluation studies are substantial investments that may lead to waste and even harm if not well conducted. Traditional QI methodologies, commonly used in DNP projects, were found to be uncertain in improving health care outcomes. The complexity of health care systems calls for cross-fertilization between improvement and implementation sciences to improve health care outcomes.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>OBJECTIVE</title>\n                        <p>This study describes the development, implementation, and evaluation of a hybrid model for QI and program evaluation studies to guide scholarship in the DNP program.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>METHODS</title>\n                        <p>The hybrid model was based on cross-fertilization between improvement and implementation sciences. The model adapted the Getting to Outcome (GTO) and Knowledge to Action (KTA) models as the overarching process models for knowledge implementation. Within each phase of the GTO and KTA models, expected barriers and facilitators for the implementation and adoption of innovation were identified based on the CFIR (Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research). Accordingly, strategies to facilitate the implementation and adoption of innovations were identified based on a refined list of implementation strategies and QI tools. The choice of these models was based on the top 5 criteria for selecting implementation science theories and frameworks. Seven DNP students used the hybrid model to conduct QI projects. Students evaluated their experiences by responding to a Qualtrics survey.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>RESULTS</title>\n                        <p>The hybrid model encouraged a comprehensive systematic way of thinking, provided tools essential to implementation success, emphasized the need for adaptability in implementation, maintained rigor in QI, and guided the sustainability of change initiatives. Some of the challenges faced by students included finding reliable and valid measures, attaining and maintaining staff buy-in, and competing organizational priorities.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>\n                        <p>Cross-fertilization between improvement and implementation sciences provided a roadmap and systematic thinking for successful QI projects in the DNP program. The integration of the CFIR with the GTO or KTA process models, enforced by the use of evidence-based implementation strategies and QI tools, reflected the complexity of health care systems and emphasized the need for adaptability in implementation.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT</title>\n                        <p>RR1-10.2196/54213</p>\n                </sec>",

The study identifies relevant design parameters that should be considered in the development of this design strategy.</P></P><P>Design/methodology/approach<P>The empirical data were collected through observations of the design process of two new sport facilities, meetings with sport, well-being and aging experts and through semi-structured interviews with end-users. The development of the proposed design strategy is based on a methodology with elements from &ldquo;Knowledge to Action (KTA),&rdquo; &ldquo;Action research&rdquo; and a &ldquo;List of value concepts.&rdquo; The rigid timetable guaranteed systematic progress, where both knowledge from the end-users and experts were incorporated throughout the decision-making process.</P></P><P>Findings<P>The two case studies documented results involving end-users and experts in a systematic way. In conclusion, it was apparent that the use of interdisciplinary collaboration informed the design outcome.</P></P><P>Practical implications<P>Based on the two cases, the following advice can be given to the architectural profession: architects should use the KTA model or similar in order to target the search for relevant interdisciplinary knowledge and ensure that relevant evidence is involved in the design process of upcoming projects regarding sport and recreation. Architects should make the design process transparent so that one can see which design decisions have been made through the design process. This must be done to ensure that there is greater coherence between vision and practice.</P></P><P>Originality/value<P>The study showed how architects could import knowledge, skills and values from other disciplines such as environmental psychology and active living research to improve the decision-making process of future sport and recreation projects. It was also clear that this design decision process could be made more transparent in the effort to allow the various stakeholders to take ownership of the resulting design outcomes.</P></P>",

         "<P>Background People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have unique housing and support needs that are essential for maintaining independence at home; however, there is limited research to guide the design of community living options for this population. The aim of this study was to examine housing and support needs and preferences of people with MS with the intention to inform the planning of a co-designed intervention based on the study&rsquo;s findings. Methods Using the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework, quantitative (n = 79) and qualitative (n = 6) data from people with MS were extracted and integrated from projects completed by the research team that explored the housing and support needs and preferences of people with disability. Results were synthesised and presented to a reference group for validation, contextualisation, and adaptation to the Australian context. Results High physical support needs were common across participants. People most commonly required home modifications to improve accessibility, such as ramps, equipment such as heating and cooling, and assistive technology. Many people required more than 8 hours per day of paid support. Moving into individualised housing facilitated independence and community reintegration. People reported gaps between what they wanted from support workers and what they received, citing individual and systemic barriers. Conclusion People with MS have support needs that require proactive and responsive funding arrangements, housing design and support provision. In line with KTA principles, findings will inform the planning of a co-designed intervention that involves people with lived experience of MS and other stakeholders to influence policy and improve home and living outcomes for this population.</P>",

Only two (6%) projects reported having measured sustainability of their projects and four (11%) measured long-term impact. A focus group with six researchers and individual interviews with nine clinicians highlighted the benefits (e.g. acquired collaborative skills, stronger networks between clinicians and academia) and challenges (e.g. measuring KT outcomes, lack of planning for sustainability, barriers related to clinician involvement in research) of participating in this initiative. Considerations when partnering on IKT projects included: the importance of having a supportive organization culture and physical proximity between collaborators, sharing motives for participating, leveraging everyone’s expertise, grounding projects in KT models, discussing feasibility of projects on a restricted timeline, and incorporating the necessary knowledge users.

         "Analyzing Public Access and Boundary Utilization in Landscape Architecture",
         "(Background and Purpose) In contemporary society, Landscape Architecture crucially addresses the relationships between architecture and landscape, as well as individual and public realms within cities, establishing boundaries as areas with potential for communication while maintaining continuity between buildings and land. Despite the existence of developments ranging from single buildings to large-scale urban projects, many boundary and green spaces are currently applied in cities in isolated and passive ways, with limited functionality in terms of accessibility and publicness. Furthermore, the potential of Landscape Architecture to function diversely within urban environments is underutilized due to a lack of research on its boundary components and methods, compounded by uniform regulations. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes using the boundary spaces of buildings as a solution to practical urban problems, examining the construction methods and components of Landscape Architecture's boundary spaces to advance the concept of 'publicness' in both current and future architectural developments. (Method) This research employs case studies to examine the integration methods of Landscape Architecture within urban conditions, leveraging landscape concepts to bridge diverse aspects and elements. The study emphasizes the critical elements of Landscape Architecture, such as the rates of 'open area' and 'openness,' by investigating international architectural projects. These case studies are instrumental in understanding the types, access, efficiency, and rates of open areas, which are pivotal in expressing the public usage of Landscape Architectures numerically. (Results) The boundary spaces of Landscape Architecture, reflecting the urban context and locality, have shown high potential for public use and were categorized for analysis accordingly. This study introduced an innovative 'publicness graph,' linking objective indicators like 'public area ratio' and 'openness' to visualize detailed characteristics. By defining the Public Occupancy Index (POI) and Balance Deviation Index (BDI), the study quantitatively categorized the 'publicness' of individual buildings, which had previously been expressed qualitatively. (Conclusions) The study concludes that Landscape Architecture holds the potential to revolutionize the design and functionality of public spaces within urban landscapes. Through case analysis and conceptual establishment of the use of boundary spaces in landscape architecture, a quantitative analysis method has been presented. By applying the types of 'Street type', 'Park type', and 'Street + Park type' as case studies, the validity of the analytical method that quantifies the individual characteristics of buildings associated with publicness proposed in this paper has been confirmed. The analysis method based on the 'Publicness Graph' is expected to contribute significantly to the development of design plans and models that can optimize the public use of increasingly complex boundary spaces in modern architecture.",

         "<P>As the sustainability of contemporary cities has gained emphasis, interest in architecture has increased, due to its social and public responsibility. Since sustainability is linked to public values, research on sustainable public spaces is an important way to secure sustainability in cities. Based on this, we analyzed the sustainability of European cities by examining the design methods of public architecture according to the region. The aim of the study is to derive architectural methodology corresponding to local characteristics, and to suggest issues to consider in public architecture design to promote urban sustainability based on this. First, regarding the environmental aspect, it can be observed that there is an effort to secure sustainability. Second, in terms of social sustainability, historical value remains as a trace of architectural place, so that it continues in people&rsquo;s memory. In addition, public architecture provides public places where citizens can gather and enjoy programs, while the architectural methods showed differences influenced by cultural conditions. Third, in economic sustainability, it was shown that energy saving was achieved through cost reduction through recycling of materials, facilities, or environmental factors. In conclusion, the issues to be considered in public architectural design are the voiding of urban space through architectural devices in the construction method. In other words, the intention is to form &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that attempts to be part of the city, and thereby create better places. Since skin and material have a deep relationship with the environment, they should have the durability and an outer skin that are suitable for the regional environment. Finally, sustainability is to be utilized through the influx of programs that meet local and environmental characteristics. Design research into public architecture that is oriented towards urban sustainability will be a task to be carried out by the present generation for the millennial generation.</P>",

         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P><B>Background</B></P> <P>Public health and environmental challenges facing the world in the 21st century, including the ageing population, increasing urbanisation, rise of non-communicable diseases and climate instability, require an interdisciplinary response. A significant proportion of the population's time is spent indoors, be it at home, school, work or in leisure time; the work of an architect can cover all of these sectors, but their role in health and well-being remains an under explored area.</P>   <P><B>Objective</B></P> <P>This article examines the architecture profession's potential to contribute to improved health and well-being of the population through healthier buildings and places.</P>   <P><B>Methodology</B></P> <P>This short communication adopts a descriptive approach. First, it maps the remit, skills and influence of the architecture profession and applies this to a well-accepted public health model, the prevention pyramid. Second, it uses themes identified by the Royal Society for Public Health to discuss ways to improve engagement with the architecture profession as part of the wider public health workforce.</P>   <P><B>Results</B></P> <P>This article finds that the remit, skills and potential influence of architects places them in a key position to improve the health and well-being of the population. Despite this, there has been relatively little engagement between public health and this profession. Much more attention to date has been on integrating the planning sector with public health.</P>   <P><B>Conclusion</B></P> <P>Opportunities for improved engagement exist through partnership working, incorporating health into both undergraduate and postgraduate education and continuing professional development training, building the evidence base and developing architecture and health-related policy and legislation.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  The architecture profession can contribute to primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. </LI> <LI>  There has been little engagement between public health and the architecture profession. </LI> <LI>  Opportunities are partnership working, addressing training needs and building the evidence base. </LI> </UL> </P>",

The current status of public administration information systems is intertwined architecture with many isolated parts that are not interconnected. Strategic guidelines at the state level are the basis for achieving the goals for all public administration bodies to work on a common IT platform, along with the linked business processes and services. The concept of enterprise architecture for public administration bodies can serve as a vision of the desired state and as an impulse for launching activities aimed at consolidating and modernizing the system. Since enterprise architecture serves as a link between business and technology, it can be the basis for linking separate business units of public administration bodies into a single system, while accelerating information sharing and raising the level of availability of the required data.</P>",

         "<P>Interreligious engagement (IE) has been experienced and theorized mainly as the pursuit of a shared respectful awareness of the beliefs, practices, and social experiences of multiple religious communities. In rare instances, it has been possible to create architecture specifically to foster IE, as in the &ldquo;tri-faith&rdquo; Abrahamic campus in Omaha and the Berlin House of One. The theme is: Here we are, accepting that we share the world. Another form of IE that deserves to attract more interest is multireligious collaboration in civic work (addressing homelessness, urban blight, illiteracy, etc.). Some adherents of the intrinsically cosmopolitan &ldquo;world&rdquo; religions are actively cosmopolitan to the extent of seeking this engagement. The theme is: Let us share the work of the world, including sharing our religiously inflected processing of what the practical issues facing us are. There is a new initiative of this sort in my city, Jackson, Mississippi, named (from M. L. King) the &ldquo;Beloved Community&rdquo;. An architectural thought experiment may prove helpful in articulating the ideals for such an endeavor. What would be the physical desiderata for its headquarters? Let us imagine a new downtown building, The Meeting, dedicated to housing meetings where mixed religious groups learn about civic issues and coordinate efforts to address them. Full interreligious sharing of a space seems to require a neutral design lacking any definite religious inspiration. But there are nonsectarian ways to create an appreciably special, non-ordinary space, as in courtrooms and classrooms. Could a civic IE headquarters be special, expressive of practical optimism, and contain a sufficient religious allusion to qualify as a &ldquo;next-to-sacred space&rdquo; in which religious actors felt supported in the civic extension of their religious lives? I offer suggestions for discussion, including (1) a pavilion-style building suggestive of being set up for a special purpose-not soaringly grandiose but with a vertical feature such as a central roof lantern; (2) at least one major porch, with benches and tables; (3) an outside water fountain with public water supply (a historical allusion to the Islamic sabil); (4) inside, right-sized meeting rooms around the glass-walled periphery; (5) a big &ldquo;living room&rdquo; lounge in the center, usable for larger meetings, with access to a kitchen, and with a big project board for tracking work completed and work in hand next to a large map of the city; (6) a moderate descent of several steps into each meeting room so that there is a feeling of commitment in attending a meeting and a sense of challenge in going forth from one; (7) otherwise a main floor levelness and openness facilitating movement in and out, as in a train station; and (8) upstairs small offices for religious and other qualifying organizations. Answering the aesthetic and practical questions these suggestions raise takes us into imagining civic IE more concretely.</P>",

         "<P>Purpose<P>The aim of this article is to develop an architectural pedagogy for the Anthropocene. The author reflect on a project within a postgraduate architectural theory module to address the following questions: How can architectural pedagogy articulate critical modes of production that contribute to quality education in the time of the Anthropocene? What are the ideas, values and practices needed?</P></P><P>Design/methodology/approach<P>The method employed is close reading of texts focussed on three areas: critical theory and pedagogy, political theory and the Anthropocene, and architectural theory and typological urbanism. These theoretical narratives are placed in dialogue with a reflection on a design research pedagogical project. The theoretical narratives and design research project seek to articulate the multidimensionality of critical education.

Analysis of the site's defensive architecture provides unique information about the city's internal design. Dry moats, walled roads, and steep terrace facades subdivide the community into a series of population segments that on the basis of both size and architecture type resemble ward divisions found in central Mexico cities at the time of Conquest. Furthermore, Xochicalco does not have a single defensive perimeter characteristic of a strongly centralized polity; instead, it possesses a series of defensive precincts located on the hills and ridges adjacent to Cerro Xochicalco that are equivalent in form and redundant in function. The model that best approximates the segmentary nature of this structure is that of a regional confederacy dominated by Xochicalco during the Epiclassic.</P></P></▼1><▼2><P><B>RESUMEN</B><P>Este estudio presenta un resumen del dise&ntilde;o y la organizati&oacute;n arquitect&oacute;nica en la ciudad de Xochicalco, Morelos, en el altiplano central de M&eacute;xico durante el epicl&aacute;sico (700-900 d.C).

         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Heat wave (HW) periods, which are characterized by unusual high temperatures and heat stress, are known as one of the global issues that negatively affect the land and atmosphere, especially in urban areas. Higher urbanization rates in cities may result in high temperature warming, which is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Recently, researchers have revealed pronounced effects based on HW and UHI interactions; however, studies that linked their effects with surface energy fluxes in different urban landscape and climate are still inadequate. This study utilized the Community Land Model (CLM) to assess the effect of HW towards UHI, while considering energy fluxes variations in Seoul, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and Melbourne, with different climate influences and urban morphologies. Generally, Seoul and Tokyo showed intense HW magnitude from 2000 to 2018 based on the HW indices. The surface energy flux components demonstrated a distinct pattern especially from 11:00 to 17:00, with the exception of sensible heat in Melbourne. Further energy-flux partitioning revealed that changes in the heat storage ratio were most significant in Seoul, with 1.39 partitioning due to its larger impervious area. A smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio of open mid-rise building has enhanced urban warming in Melbourne, whereas smaller impervious and larger pervious road fraction could mitigate urban warming effects in Kuala Lumpur. Seoul showed the highest changes in daytime UHI under HW at 2.01 &deg;C, due to the low convection efficiency in compact high-rise building, while nighttime UHI was highly influenced by heat storage and anthropogenic heat release.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Seoul and Tokyo have more intense heat waves (HWs) during 2000&ndash;2018. </LI> <LI>  Latent heat, heat storage, and net radiation changed consistently from 11:00 to 17:00 during HW events. </LI> <LI>  City that has compact building type contributed to the highest heat storage ratio. </LI> <LI>  Smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio enhanced urban warming under HWs. </LI> <LI>  Urban heat island was enhanced under HW occurrences. </LI> </UL> </P>",

Here, we describe the implementation of our BCI speech synthesis system, which can be trained with a limited amount of overt speech to produce a continuous stream of audio outputs during subsequent speech imagery tasks. We evaluate (1) the effect of parameter choices on the execution time of individual operations in the BCI loop and (2) the accuracy of predicted outputs. To confirm the feasibility of our approach, we conduct simulations in a pseudo-prospective fashion using recorded datasets from five patients undergoing intracranial epilepsy monitoring. We propose that our system can be used to synthesize different types of speech under specific clinical constraints.</P>",

         "This paper begins by situating the large screen in Melbourne as part of the industrial cluster development of the Southbank cultural precinct. It examines urban regeneration and cultural policies to map the politics of its spatial geography of agglomeration. It further explores the role of networked screen in the formation of a transnational creative cluster. Using a telematic large screen event staged across Melbourne and Seoul, the paper evaluates the responses of audiences to examine the politics of cultural and civic engagement. While scholarships on creative clusters predominantly focus on the new value chain of industrial and commercial production that arises as a result of agglomeration, this paper argues that the large screen possesses the capacity not only to invigorate public participation, but as a transnational creative cluster, the networked large screen also possesses the potential to enhance the quality of intercultural communication between Asia and Australia.",

         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P><P>A 12 month study of urban concentrations of total suspended particulates (TSP) and 20 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was carried out in Seoul (South Korea), Hong Kong, Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia) and Melbourne (Australia). Concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere varied widely between the cities over the course of the study, ranging from a low of 24.1&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Melbourne during the winter to a high of 376.2&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Jakarta during the dry season. Seasonal variations in both TSP and PAH were observed in the tropical cities in the study with higher concentrations during the dry season and lower concentrations during the wet season. TSP and PAH concentrations are correlated with each other in these cities, suggesting that they have related sources and sinks for these cities. In the temperate cities of Melbourne and Seoul, PAH concentrations were higher during the cold winter season and lower during the warm summer. However, TSP was quite variable over the years in these latter cities and no clear seasonal trend was observed. A number of factors have been investigated which could be contributing to seasonal variations in pollutant levels. In the temperate climates, increased emissions due to the use of fossil fuels for heating in the winter is evident. However, an interrogation of the database with respect to the other factors such as (1)increased photolytic degradation during the summer, (2)transport of pollutants from other sources, (3)removal of PAH via wet deposition and in-cloud scavenging mechanisms and (4)volatilisation of lower molecular weight species during periods of high temperature indicates the importance of multiple processes. Even though there are clearly much lower levels of both particulates and PAH in the wet season of the tropical climates, no statistically significant correlations have been observed between rainfall levels and pollutant concentrations.</P>",

It is difficult to get satisfactory results as not all data is reliable and valuable from the internet. To solve this problem, researchers recommend using a recommendation system which presents relevant information instead of searching the same information multiple times. Generally, collaborative filtering methods based on user information (such as gender type, geographical area, or preference) are effective. However, in today&#x2019;s era, everyone is concerned about suggestions or guidelines so that he/she can make the decision, our area of research includes movies recommendation system by which we can provide the list of similar movies to the user. Now the user is assisted with some lists of movies recommended to the user by our model, he/she only has to decide which movie he should watch next. Instead of looking into the whole list it&#x2019;s better to have some recommendations based on which he/she can decide easily.

         "<P><B>Abstract</B><P>Background:<P>Narmafotinib is a highly potent and selective, orally bioavailable inhibitor of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase over-expressed in pancreatic cancer, where it contributes to cell survival, proliferation, migration and chemoresistance and thus plays a key role in tumour growth. FAK also contributes to multiple mechanisms underlying fibrosis and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. A Phase 1b/2a trial - the ACCENT trial - investigates narmafotinib in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in advanced pancreatic cancer patients; Phase 1b is complete, with Phase 2a currently underway in Australia and South Korea.</P></P><P>Methods:<P>The ACCENT trial (NCT05355298) is an open-label two-part study of the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability, and efficacy of narmafotinib in combination with standard gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) as first-line therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients received narmafotinib as monotherapy on days -8 to -2 and then again as 4-day pulses beginning on days 3, 10 and 24 of each 28-day chemotherapy cycle. In Part A, patients were enrolled in a 3+3 combination design with sequentially escalating doses of narmafotinib (100, 200 or 400 mg, qd) to identify a suitable Phase 2 dose. Narmafotinib plasma PK was assessed during monotherapy and Cycle 1. Imaging was conducted every 2 months and evaluated using RECIST 1.1. Part B utilizes a Simon&rsquo;s two-stage design at 400 mg narmafotinib, with the primary objectives of assessing safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination.</P></P><P>Results:<P>Preliminary Phase 1b (Part A) analysis across all doses (14 patients) showed narmafotinib to be generally safe and well-tolerated with promising signs of efficacy indicating a dose-dependent increase in duration of treatment and best response. Five confirmed partial responses (4 at 400 mg narmafotinib; 1 at 200 mg) were recorded and 4/6 patients on 400 mg narmafotinib received treatment for >6 months. A dose of 400 mg qd of narmafotinib was selected for the Phase 2a (Part B) study. Preliminary Part B analysis from the initial 26 patients showed narmafotinib to be generally safe and well-tolerated with promising signs of efficacy, with 10 confirmed partial responses observed to date. The median duration on trial (DoT) continues to demonstrate a significant improvement over the historical gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel combination. Narmafotinib continues to be well-tolerated. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were predominately mild to moderate and included nausea (20.5%), diarrhea (12.8%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (10.3%).</P></P><P>Conclusions:<P>Preliminary Part B analysis on the initial 26 patients showed narmafotinib to be safe and well-tolerated with promising signs of efficacy.</P></P><P>Citation Format:<P>Terrie-Anne Cock, Sarah Kinkel, Nicole Kruger, Charlotte Mulder, Ananda Sumitra, Marion Harris, Warren Joubert, Lara Lipton, Adnan Nagrial, Nick Pavlakis, Jin Won Kim, Choong-kun Lee, Do-Youn Oh, Joon Oh Park, Woo-Jin Lee, Jason Lickliter, Christopher Burns.

         "기술의 발전과 사회구조의 변화는 새로운 소비 형태의 등장에 큰 영향을 주었다. 고객들은 다양하고 새로운 경험을 추구하며 그 범위는 공간으로 확장되었다. 특히, 고객과 가장 밀접한 커뮤니케이션 역할을 하는 공간의 표현은 더욱 빠른 대응이 필요했으며, 과거의 단순 디스플레이와 판매를 넘어선 변화가 필요했다. 흔히 트렌드의 영향을 받는 패션 스토어는 다양한 사조에 의해 표현되며 가장 대표적으로 미니멀리즘 컨셉의 적용을 말할 수 있다. 다양한 사조의 대립이 일어났던 1960년대에 오브제 트루베와의 복합 개념으로 생겨난 미니멀리즘은 꾸준히 조형예술 분야에서 다양한 양상으로 표현되고 있다. 여러 분야에서 진행된 연구들은 미니멀리즘이 동양사상의 영향을 받았을 것으로 추정하며, 이 두 개념이 근본적으로 같은 내용을 담고 있음에도 불구하고 지역의 공간관에 따라 표현의 차이가 존재한다. &amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 본 연구는 동양과 서양이라는 지역적 차이에 따라 나타나는 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘 적용 양상을 분석함으로써, 향후 효과적인 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘 표현 특성 제시에 목적이 있다. 연구 방법으로는 선행연구와 문헌조사를 통해 미니멀리즘의 표현 특성과 스토어 공간 구성 요소를 정리한 다음 인터넷 자료 조사 및 공식 홈페이지를 참고해 사례분석을 진행했다.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 패션 스토어의 공간 구성 요소는 파사드, 벽, 바닥, 기둥, 천장 등 주로 고정적 요소로 구성된 ‘공간요소’, 집기, 소도구, 카운터, 조명 등 단순 디스플레이를 나타내는 ‘진열요소’, VP, PP, IP로 이루어진 ‘연출요소’로 설명할 수 있다. 특히, 2010년대를 기점으로 스토어 구성 요소의 정리에 있어 VMD의 역할을 하는 연출요소의 구분이 이루어졌다. 그리고 미니멀리즘의 특성은 절제되며 단순기하학적 표현의 ‘단순성’, 은유적 의미를 제거한 ‘단일성’, 계층적 관계를 탈피하기 위한 표준 단위의 반복 배열의 ‘반복성’, 물체성을 강조하는 ‘환원성’, 주위환경과 연관해 장소성을 포함하고 있는 ‘환경성’으로 구성된다. 이와 같은 미니멀리즘의 다섯 가지 특성들은 공간에서 적용을 통해 세 가지로 구분할 수 있다. 먼저, 폐쇄성과 확장성을 표현하는 ‘공간적 특성’, 단순성과 반복성의 ‘형태적 특성’, 물성과 비물성을 통한 ‘재료적 특성’으로 이루어진다. &amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 앞서 도출된 내용을 바탕으로 사례분석을 진행했다. 분석대상은 한중일로 한정한 동양의 패션 스토어 11곳과 유럽미국을 중심으로 한 서양의 패션 스토어 13곳, 총 24곳으로 의류 중심의 판매가 이루어지는 패션 스토어 중 디자이너의 인터뷰에서 미니멀리즘 컨셉을 언급하거나 작품 설명에 명시한 작품을 도출했다.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 사례분석 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, 패션 스토어의 공간 구성에 따른 미니멀리즘은 진열요소&amp;lt;고정요소&amp;lt;연출요소의 순서로 나타나며, 미니멀리즘 표현 특성은 공간표현특성&amp;lt;재료표현특성&amp;lt;형태표현특성으로 나타났다. 둘째, 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘은 동·서양의 영향을 받지 않으며, 앞서 분석한 평균과 같은 양상을 보였지만, 공간표현에서의 차이가 발생했다. 같은 컨셉의 적용임에도 불구하고 생기는 공간표현의 차이는 공간관에 의거하며, 동양 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘은 형태와 환경의 어울림을 추구하며 무(無)로 인해 생기는 공간(空間)의 특성으로 동양의 공간관과 무(無)의 개념이 내재되어 있음을 확인할 수 있다. 서양 패션 스토어의 미니멀리즘은 단조로운 색채 속 포인트 컬러를 통해 공간을 풍부하게 만들며, 물리적 폐쇄성과 확장성 표현의 공존이 거의 나타나지 않는다. 이처럼 이분법적 사고의 표현으로 객관적 공간을 추구한다. 셋째, 동서양 패션 스토어의 공통 요소로는 단순성과 반복성, 물성의 표현으로 특히, 노출 콘크리트와 스테인리스, 목재 등의 사용을 통해 환원성을 표현한다. 반대로 비물성의 경우 국부적으로 사용하고 있으며, 이와 같은 컨셉의 표현은 연출요소에 의해 많은 영향을 받고있는 것을 확인할 수 있었다.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 따라서 동서양 패션 스토어에 적용된 미니멀리즘 표현은 공간표현의 차이를 보이고 있었으며 직접적 언급이 없음에도 불구하고 지역에 따른 공간관이 내재되어 표현되었다. 본 연구는 패션 스토어에 적용된 동서양의 미니멀리즘 표현 차이를 확인했다는 점에서 의미를 찾을 수 있다. 본 연구를 통해 패션 스토어에서 미니멀리즘의 적용에 있어 더욱 효과적인 방향을 제시할 것이라 예상하며 추후 지역에 따른 정확한 비교를 위한 연구의 진행이 필요할 것으로 판단된다.",

         "<P><B>Background</B></P><P>Conceptual frameworks are recommended as a way of applying theory to enhance implementation efforts. The Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework was developed in Canada by Graham and colleagues in the 2000s, following a review of 31 planned action theories. The framework has two components: Knowledge Creation and an Action Cycle, each of which comprises multiple phases. This review sought to answer two questions: ‘Is the KTA Framework used in practice? And if so, how?’</P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P>This study is a citation analysis and systematic review. The index citation for the original paper was identified on three databases&#x2014;Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar&#x2014;with the facility for citation searching. Limitations of English language and year of publication 2006-June 2013 were set. A taxonomy categorising the continuum of usage was developed. Only studies applying the framework to implementation projects were included. Data were extracted and mapped against each phase of the framework for studies where it was integral to the implementation project.</P><P><B>Results</B></P><P>The citation search yielded 1,787 records. A total of 1,057 titles and abstracts were screened. One hundred and forty-six studies described usage to varying degrees, ranging from referenced to integrated. In ten studies, the KTA Framework was integral to the design, delivery and evaluation of the implementation activities. All ten described using the Action Cycle and seven referred to Knowledge Creation. The KTA Framework was enacted in different health care and academic settings with projects targeted at patients, the public, and nursing and allied health professionals.</P><P><B>Conclusions</B></P><P>The KTA Framework is being used in practice with varying degrees of completeness. It is frequently cited, with usage ranging from simple attribution via a reference, through informing planning, to making an intellectual contribution. When the framework was integral to knowledge translation, it guided action in idiosyncratic ways and there was theory fidelity. Prevailing wisdom encourages the use of theories, models and conceptual frameworks, yet their application is less evident in practice. This may be an artefact of reporting, indicating that prospective, primary research is needed to explore the real value of the KTA Framework and similar tools.</P><P><B>Electronic supplementary material</B></P><P>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13012-014-0172-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</P>",

Criteria weighting and technological importance ranking were determined by means of the Analytic Hierarchy Process as a decision aid, along with hierarchical representation and pairwise comparisons. The opinions derived from three divisions of KTA were analyzed and aggregated. Such aggregated prioritization weighting of technologies allows the corporation management to use it for funding decisions about technological aspects of its long-range planning for R&D projects during the period from 1992 to 2006; especially those concerning baseline budget level selection and the scope of research activities.",

         "<P>Background People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have unique housing and support needs that are essential for maintaining independence at home; however, there is limited research to guide the design of community living options for this population. The aim of this study was to examine housing and support needs and preferences of people with MS with the intention to inform the planning of a co-designed intervention based on the study&rsquo;s findings. Methods Using the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework, quantitative (n = 79) and qualitative (n = 6) data from people with MS were extracted and integrated from projects completed by the research team that explored the housing and support needs and preferences of people with disability. Results were synthesised and presented to a reference group for validation, contextualisation, and adaptation to the Australian context. Results High physical support needs were common across participants. People most commonly required home modifications to improve accessibility, such as ramps, equipment such as heating and cooling, and assistive technology. Many people required more than 8 hours per day of paid support. Moving into individualised housing facilitated independence and community reintegration. People reported gaps between what they wanted from support workers and what they received, citing individual and systemic barriers. Conclusion People with MS have support needs that require proactive and responsive funding arrangements, housing design and support provision. In line with KTA principles, findings will inform the planning of a co-designed intervention that involves people with lived experience of MS and other stakeholders to influence policy and improve home and living outcomes for this population.</P>",

         "<P><B>Background</B></P><P>Integrated knowledge translation (IKT) can optimize the uptake of research evidence into clinical practice by incorporating knowledge users as equal partners in the entire research process. Although several studies have investigated stakeholder involvement in research, the literature on partnerships between researchers and clinicians in rehabilitation and their impact on clinical practice is scarce.

Only two (6%) projects reported having measured sustainability of their projects and four (11%) measured long-term impact. A focus group with six researchers and individual interviews with nine clinicians highlighted the benefits (e.g. acquired collaborative skills, stronger networks between clinicians and academia) and challenges (e.g. measuring KT outcomes, lack of planning for sustainability, barriers related to clinician involvement in research) of participating in this initiative. Considerations when partnering on IKT projects included: the importance of having a supportive organization culture and physical proximity between collaborators, sharing motives for participating, leveraging everyone’s expertise, grounding projects in KT models, discussing feasibility of projects on a restricted timeline, and incorporating the necessary knowledge users. Clinicians discussed the main outputs (scientific contribution, training and development, increased awareness of best practice, step in a larger effort) as project outcomes, but highlighted the complexity of measuring outcomes on clinical practice.</P><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P>The study provides a portrait of an IKT funding model, sheds light on past IKT projects’ strengths and weaknesses and provides strategies for promoting positive partnership experiences between researchers and rehabilitation clinicians.</P><P><B>Electronic supplementary material</B></P><P>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12913-019-4061-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</P>",

         "Analyzing Public Access and Boundary Utilization in Landscape Architecture",
         "(Background and Purpose) In contemporary society, Landscape Architecture crucially addresses the relationships between architecture and landscape, as well as individual and public realms within cities, establishing boundaries as areas with potential for communication while maintaining continuity between buildings and land. Despite the existence of developments ranging from single buildings to large-scale urban projects, many boundary and green spaces are currently applied in cities in isolated and passive ways, with limited functionality in terms of accessibility and publicness. Furthermore, the potential of Landscape Architecture to function diversely within urban environments is underutilized due to a lack of research on its boundary components and methods, compounded by uniform regulations. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes using the boundary spaces of buildings as a solution to practical urban problems, examining the construction methods and components of Landscape Architecture's boundary spaces to advance the concept of 'publicness' in both current and future architectural developments. (Method) This research employs case studies to examine the integration methods of Landscape Architecture within urban conditions, leveraging landscape concepts to bridge diverse aspects and elements. The study emphasizes the critical elements of Landscape Architecture, such as the rates of 'open area' and 'openness,' by investigating international architectural projects. These case studies are instrumental in understanding the types, access, efficiency, and rates of open areas, which are pivotal in expressing the public usage of Landscape Architectures numerically. (Results) The boundary spaces of Landscape Architecture, reflecting the urban context and locality, have shown high potential for public use and were categorized for analysis accordingly. This study introduced an innovative 'publicness graph,' linking objective indicators like 'public area ratio' and 'openness' to visualize detailed characteristics. By defining the Public Occupancy Index (POI) and Balance Deviation Index (BDI), the study quantitatively categorized the 'publicness' of individual buildings, which had previously been expressed qualitatively. (Conclusions) The study concludes that Landscape Architecture holds the potential to revolutionize the design and functionality of public spaces within urban landscapes. Through case analysis and conceptual establishment of the use of boundary spaces in landscape architecture, a quantitative analysis method has been presented. By applying the types of 'Street type', 'Park type', and 'Street + Park type' as case studies, the validity of the analytical method that quantifies the individual characteristics of buildings associated with publicness proposed in this paper has been confirmed. The analysis method based on the 'Publicness Graph' is expected to contribute significantly to the development of design plans and models that can optimize the public use of increasingly complex boundary spaces in modern architecture.",

         "Urban Sustainability through Public Architecture",
         "<P>As the sustainability of contemporary cities has gained emphasis, interest in architecture has increased, due to its social and public responsibility. Since sustainability is linked to public values, research on sustainable public spaces is an important way to secure sustainability in cities. Based on this, we analyzed the sustainability of European cities by examining the design methods of public architecture according to the region. The aim of the study is to derive architectural methodology corresponding to local characteristics, and to suggest issues to consider in public architecture design to promote urban sustainability based on this. First, regarding the environmental aspect, it can be observed that there is an effort to secure sustainability. Second, in terms of social sustainability, historical value remains as a trace of architectural place, so that it continues in people&rsquo;s memory. In addition, public architecture provides public places where citizens can gather and enjoy programs, while the architectural methods showed differences influenced by cultural conditions. Third, in economic sustainability, it was shown that energy saving was achieved through cost reduction through recycling of materials, facilities, or environmental factors. In conclusion, the issues to be considered in public architectural design are the voiding of urban space through architectural devices in the construction method. In other words, the intention is to form &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that attempts to be part of the city, and thereby create better places. Since skin and material have a deep relationship with the environment, they should have the durability and an outer skin that are suitable for the regional environment. Finally, sustainability is to be utilized through the influx of programs that meet local and environmental characteristics. Design research into public architecture that is oriented towards urban sustainability will be a task to be carried out by the present generation for the millennial generation.</P>",

         "<P>Interreligious engagement (IE) has been experienced and theorized mainly as the pursuit of a shared respectful awareness of the beliefs, practices, and social experiences of multiple religious communities. In rare instances, it has been possible to create architecture specifically to foster IE, as in the &ldquo;tri-faith&rdquo; Abrahamic campus in Omaha and the Berlin House of One. The theme is: Here we are, accepting that we share the world. Another form of IE that deserves to attract more interest is multireligious collaboration in civic work (addressing homelessness, urban blight, illiteracy, etc.). Some adherents of the intrinsically cosmopolitan &ldquo;world&rdquo; religions are actively cosmopolitan to the extent of seeking this engagement. The theme is: Let us share the work of the world, including sharing our religiously inflected processing of what the practical issues facing us are. There is a new initiative of this sort in my city, Jackson, Mississippi, named (from M. L. King) the &ldquo;Beloved Community&rdquo;. An architectural thought experiment may prove helpful in articulating the ideals for such an endeavor. What would be the physical desiderata for its headquarters? Let us imagine a new downtown building, The Meeting, dedicated to housing meetings where mixed religious groups learn about civic issues and coordinate efforts to address them. Full interreligious sharing of a space seems to require a neutral design lacking any definite religious inspiration. But there are nonsectarian ways to create an appreciably special, non-ordinary space, as in courtrooms and classrooms. Could a civic IE headquarters be special, expressive of practical optimism, and contain a sufficient religious allusion to qualify as a &ldquo;next-to-sacred space&rdquo; in which religious actors felt supported in the civic extension of their religious lives? I offer suggestions for discussion, including (1) a pavilion-style building suggestive of being set up for a special purpose-not soaringly grandiose but with a vertical feature such as a central roof lantern; (2) at least one major porch, with benches and tables; (3) an outside water fountain with public water supply (a historical allusion to the Islamic sabil); (4) inside, right-sized meeting rooms around the glass-walled periphery; (5) a big &ldquo;living room&rdquo; lounge in the center, usable for larger meetings, with access to a kitchen, and with a big project board for tracking work completed and work in hand next to a large map of the city; (6) a moderate descent of several steps into each meeting room so that there is a feeling of commitment in attending a meeting and a sense of challenge in going forth from one; (7) otherwise a main floor levelness and openness facilitating movement in and out, as in a train station; and (8) upstairs small offices for religious and other qualifying organizations. Answering the aesthetic and practical questions these suggestions raise takes us into imagining civic IE more concretely.</P>",
