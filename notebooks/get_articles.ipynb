      "It is necessary to have a model that describes the feature of the knee Joint with a sufficient accuracy. Koreans, however, do not have their own knee joint model to be used in the total knee replacement arthroplasty. They have to use European or American models which do not match Koreans. Three-dimensional visualization techniques are found to be useful in a wide range of medical applications. Three-dimensional imaging studies such as CT(computed tomography) and MRI(magnetic resonance image) provide the primary source of patient-specific data. Three-dimensional knee joint models were constructed by image processing of the CT data of 10 subjects. Using the constructed model, the dimensions of Korean knee joint were measured. And this study proposed a three-dimensional model and data, which can be helpful to develop Korean knee implants and to analyze knee joint movements.\n"

         "<P>The object of this study is to introduce contact points' trajectories on the articulating surfaces and kinematics of knee prosthesis under various walking conditions for various types of prosthesis to help to design new prosthesis. Since in vivo measurement of knee prosthetic articulation is almost impossible, we created a 3D mathematical model consisted of the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral compartments of artificial knee joint. As the model could reproduce the comprehensive and sophisticated motion of a knee prosthesis, it is possible to generate and analyze various walking conditions with various types of knee prostheses and hence reproduce joint rotation mismatch, excessive deviation of contact points and a loft-off between the medio and lateral sides of the joint.</P>",

         "<P>Over the past few years, osteoarthritis is one of the most common knee diseases. The diagnosis and treatment of this disease is a vital importance. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown a good performance in learning the high-level features and in resolving segmentation issues. In this paper, we propose a new model of DL 3D-Res-UNet in order to accurately segment the knee cartilage from a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3D construction that allows perfectly visualizing the anatomical structure of this organ. This model is a combination of an architecture widely known in the literature for its segmentation efficiency (3D-UNet) with a residual architecture (3D-ResNet). The experimental results reveal that the suggested model can stabilize the training model, segment the cartilage from MRI very well and compete with the state of art on multiple performance metrics. The gain of precision and recall with 3DRes-UNet is given up to 15% and 26% compared to 3D-ResNet and 3D-UNet, respectively, hence the effectiveness of the suggested method.</P>",

         "<P>The statistical shape model (SSM) method that uses 2D images of the knee joint to predict the three-dimensional (3D) joint surface model has been reported in the literature. In this study, we constructed a SSM database using 152 human computed tomography (CT) knee joint models, including the femur, tibia and patella and analysed the characteristics of each principal component of the SSM. The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation). The computational time for each bone of the knee joint was within 30?s using a personal computer. The analysis of this study indicated that the SSM method could be a useful tool to construct 3D surface models of the knee with sub-millimeter accuracy in real time. Thus, it may have a broad application in computer-assisted knee surgeries that require 3D surface models of the knee.</P>",

         "<P>In this article, a novel 3D printed knee model for detecting possible errors in the planning and treatment of total knee replacement surgery is presented. This method is a first step towards automation of prosthesis placement. Thanks to the mathematically computed four-bar mechanism, it is now possible to emulate the implant insertion before the operation. This model allows the surgeon to fit the prosthesis to the patient&#x2019;s knee and to verify if the mounted position is optimal. This process can be repeated until the ideal position is found. Exact copies of the bones are made from the CT images of the patient. These resin copies of the real bones are placed in the motion model, reproducing the real patient&#x2019;s knee flexion. The model shows the implantation result with respect to the operation plan and the patient&#x2019;s kinematics. The experiment carried out on a patient&#x2019;s model according to the standard implantation shows a lift-off and sliding effect of the femoral component outside the joint area. However, this phenomenon is easily resolved if the femoral component is implanted about half a centimeter lateral to the knee&#x2019;s coronal axis. Until now, no medical research had questioned the lateral positioning of the prosthesis. This knee model provides an understanding of the important biomechanical parameters for total knee replacement surgery. This model will have a significant contribution to secure the surgery&#x2019;s success, increase patient satisfaction and reduce the overall number of revisions.</P>",

However, when implementing these measurements across multiple clinical centers, scanner variability becomes a critical consideration. Our purposes were to quantify and compare same-model variability (between repeated scans on the same MRI system) and cross-model variability (across different MRI systems) in knee cartilage thickness measurements using MRI scanners from five manufacturers, as analyzed with a specific 3D volume analysis software.</P></P><P>Methods<P>Ten healthy volunteers (eight males and two females, aged 22-60 years) underwent two scans of their right knee on 3T MRI systems from five manufacturers (Canon, Fujifilm, GE, Philips, and Siemens). The imaging protocol included fat-suppressed spoiled gradient echo and proton density weighted sequences. Cartilage regions were automatically segmented into 7 subregions using a specific deep learning-based 3D volume analysis software. This resulted in 350 measurements for same-model variability and 2,800 measurements for cross-model variability.</P></P><P>Results<P>For same-model variability, 82% of measurements showed variability &le;0.10 mm, and 98% showed variability &le;0.20 mm. For cross-model variability, 51% showed variability &le;0.10 mm, and 84% showed variability &le;0.20 mm. The mean same-model variability (0.06 ± 0.05 mm) was significantly lower than cross-model variability (0.11 ± 0.09 mm) (p < 0.001).</P></P><P>Conclusion<P>This study demonstrates that knee cartilage thickness measurements exhibit significantly higher variability across different MRI systems compared to repeated measurements on the same system, when analyzed using this specific software. This finding has important implications for multi-center studies and longitudinal assessments using different MRI systems and highlights the software-dependent nature of such variability assessments.</P></P>",

         "<P> Knee joint implants developed by western companies have been imported to Korea and used for Korean patients. However, many clinical problems occur in knee joints of Korean patients after total knee joint replacement owing to the geometric mismatch between the western implants and Korean knee joint structures. To solve these problems, a method to determine the representative dimension parameter values of Korean knee joints is introduced to aid in the design of knee joint implants appropriate for Korean patients. Measurements of the dimension parameters of 88 male Korean knee joint subjects were carried out. The distribution of the subjects versus each measured parameter value was investigated. The measured dimension parameter values of each parameter were grouped by suitable intervals called the &ldquo;size group,&rdquo; and average values of the size groups were calculated. The knee joint subjects were grouped as the &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; based on &ldquo;size group numbers&rdquo; of each parameter. From the iterative calculations to decrease the errors between the average dimension parameter values of each &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; and the dimension parameter values of the subjects, the average dimension parameter values that give less than the error criterion were determined to be the representative dimension parameter values for designing knee joint implants for Korean patients. </P>",

         "Fat pad syndrome is a knee joint condition/disease where acute or chronic inflammation occurs in the fat pad of the knee joint, and it is a cause of anterior knee pain. Fat pad syndrome usually occurs concurrently with other conditions/diseases to collectively cause anterior knee pain. No study to date has reported the treatment of anterior knee pain solely due to fat pad syndrome. Here, we report a case of fat pad syndrome of the knee joint as the sole cause of anterior knee pain in a 49-year-old woman who received integrated Korean medicine treatments (pharmacopuncture, acupuncture, herbal medicine, deep fascial meridian therapy, and chuna). Using patient-reported pain scale scores, the level of the patient's pain was relieved, and her mobility improved. Integrated Korean medicine treatments could be effective for patients who have fat pad syndrome of the knee joint.",

         "It is necessary to have a model that describes the feature of the knee joint with a sufficient accuracy. Koreans, however, do not have their own knee joint model used in the total knee replacement arthroplasty. They have to use European and American models but they do not match to Korean's knee joint components. Past days many doctors actually measured the knee joint shape using calipers while operating patients or the size of 2D image-like as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image. Recently, three-dimensional visualization techniques are found to be useful in a wide range of medical applications. Three-dimensional imaging studies such as CT and MRI provide the primary source of patient-specific data. In this study, three dimensional knee joint models were constructed by image processing of CT data for 15 persons. Using the constructed model, the size of knee joint of Korean was measured. Finally this study proposed the method and standard of measurement by using 3D knee joint model. The proposed 3D model and data and method of measurement can be helpful to develop Korean knee implant and analysis of knee joint movement.",

         "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the change of the articular cartilage thickness resulting from physiological aging in normal Korean people without any disease in knee joint. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Voluntary participants of 81 cases, physically normal and free from knee joint disease at present or in the past, were chosen for our research program. The subjects were divided into young, middle and old age group respectively for the male and female; and articular cartilage thickness using MRI were measured. RESULT: Each of the three groups reveals the tendency of decrease in the thickness of the knee joint cartilage in all of the age groups along with the increase of the age. The cartilage thickness according to age for both sex, except for the tibial medial condyle, decreased significantly. For the male subjects, the degree of decrease in cartilage thicknes indicates difference in each sections. However, in case of female, the change of articular cartilage thickness in overall sections showed more significantly decreased in young to middle age group than in middle to old age group. CONCLUSION: The results revealed the normal articular cartilage thickness of knee and time that the thickness of articular cartilage was decreased with age. And we could evaluate the severity of degenerative change of articular cartilage by comparison to normal articular cartilage thickness.",

Methods We searched 2 Korean medical electronic databases, and 2 Chinese electronic databases to find randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that treat knee injuries with Korean Medicine combined with CPM therapy. We selected studies by screening. We extracted data from selected RCTs, and analyzed RCTs by using Cochrane's Risk of bias criteria. Results 386 studies are searched, and 7 RCTs are selected. According to the study, several kinds of Korean Medicine such as hydrotherapy, decoction, acupuncture, moxibustion, and manual therapy are used with CPM therapy for the knee joint postoperative rehabilitation. We found the encouraging evidence that Korean Medicine and CPM combined therapy is more effective than single CPM therapy by alleviating pain, increasing range of motion, and improving knee function, etc. However, the risk of bias in most RCTs was judged to be uncertain. Conclusions Combination of Korean Medicine and CPM therapy can compensate the defect of single CPM therapy, and promotes the recovery of knee joint function.",

Previously, no study has reported the traditional Korean medicine treatment of knee pain mainly due to discoid meniscus. Here, we report two cases of a discoid meniscus of the knee as the cause of knee pain. Patients were diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging for discoid meniscus and received traditional Korean medicine treatments, including pharmacopuncture, acupuncture, herbal medicine, and chuna. The pain was alleviated when assessed by patient-reported pain scale scores, and the general knee condition was improved. Thus, traditional Korean medicine treatments could be effective for patients who had discoid meniscus of the knee joint in this case report.",

         "Introduction&amp;#xD; The anterolateral ligament (ALL) has recently been thought to play an important role in the rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). However, there are still some controversies in the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL. The purpose of this study was to investigate anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL using Korean cadaveric knee joints. We investigated the effect of ALL injury on its footprint distances under various knee conditions and assessed three-dimensional functional stability tests (pivot-shift and Lachmann tests) using a noninvasive triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Materials and Methods&amp;#xD; 20 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were dissected by a single surgeon. The locations of the tibial and femoral footprints of the ALL were recorded with respect to the lateral femoral epicondyle, tip of the fibular head, and Gerdy’s tubercle. The distance between the footprints were recorded in a normal knee condition. All cadavers were tested in neutral, internal, and external rotation at 30°, 60°, 90° of knee flexion. The pivot shift and Lachmann tests were measured using a triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA). Serial sectioning of the ALL and the ACL was performed after testing in normal knee joints. Measurements were collected before and after each sectioning.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Results&amp;#xD; Anatomical features of the current study were similar to those of previous cadaveric studies. The prevalence of the ALL in our study was 100%. Average distance of the tibial footprint to the tip of the fibular head was 19.85 ± 3.41 mm and to Gerdy’s tubercle was 18.3 ± 4.19mm. Average distance of the femoral footprint to the lateral femoral epicondyle was 10.25 ± 2.97mm. The footprint distance of the ALL was the longest at 30° of knee flexion (47.83 ± 8.05 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001) in a normal knee neutral rotation condition. An internal rotational force produced statistically significant increases in footprint distances in normal knees at all three knee flexion angles. During internal rotation, the footprint distance was also the longest at 30° of knee flexion (50.05 ± 8.88 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although an internal rotational force did not produce a statistically significant increase in the footprint distance after ALL transection, it increased the footprint distance at all three knee flexion angles after a combined ACL and ALL transection (p = 0.022). After a combined ACL and ALL transection, the footprint distance was the longest at 30° of knee flexion under internal rotational force (52.05 ± 7.60 mm). Pivot shift and Lachmann tests measured by the KiRA device did not show statistically significant differences between normal and ALL-transected knees. However, there were significant differences in the combined ACL-ALL-transected knees compared with normal and ALL-transected knees (p&amp;lt;0.001).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Conclusion&amp;#xD; The ALL was identified as a distinct ligament structure in this Korean cadaveric study. Considering the footprint distances of the ALL in various knee conditions, the ALL is thought to play a protective role in internal rotational stability especially at 30° of knee flexion. Isolated ALL transection did not show significant effects on the ALL footprint distances and functional stability tests. The ALL is thought to act as a secondary supportive stabilizer for rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the ACL.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Keywords: knee joint, anterolateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament, rotatory instability, KiRA, anterolateral ligament reconstruction, Korean cadaver&amp;#xD;",

Methods : We treated 3 patients who had knee joint pain and gait disturbance by knee injuries with Korean medicine and CPM treatment. We evaluated the outcomes by checking NRS, ROM, Lysholm knee score, walking state and other symptoms. Results : The NRS, ROM, Lysholm knee score, and other symptoms of 3 patients were improved before they. These results show possibilities of simultaneous treatment of Korean medicine and CPM. But there is a limit that the number of cases is not sufficient, and there was no long-term follow-up after discharge. Conclusions : Simultaneous treatment of Korean medicine and CPM has an effect on knee joint rehabilitation. Further studies are needed to prove the effectiveness of Korean medicine combined with CPM.",

         "Three-dimensional measurement of joint motion is a promising tool for clinical evaluation and therapeutic treatment comparisons. Although many devices exist for joints kinematics assessment, there is a need for a system that could be used in routine practice. Such a system should be accurate, ambulatory, and easy to use. The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics (ISB). A simple method based on a leg movement is proposed here to align two inertial measurement units fixed on the thigh and shank segments. Based on the combination of the former alignment and a fusion algorithm, the three-dimensional knee joint angle is measured and compared with a magnetic motion capture system during walking. The proposed system is suitable to measure the absolute knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction angles with mean (SD) offset errors of -1<SUP>o</SUP> (1<SUP>o</SUP>) and 0<SUP>o</SUP> (0.6<SUP>o</SUP>) and mean (SD) root mean square (RMS) errors of 1.5<SUP>o</SUP> (0.4<SUP>o</SUP>) and 1.7<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The system is also suitable for the relative measurement of knee internal/external rotation (mean (SD) offset error of 3.4<SUP>o</SUP> (2.7<SUP>o</SUP>)) with a mean (SD) RMS error of 1.6<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The method described in this paper can be easily adapted in order to measure other joint angular displacements such as elbow or ankle.",

Two methods for describing knee joint motion with 6 degrees of freedom (DOF)-Euler angle and the helical axis of motion-are discussed. Techniques to measure joint motion which can either approximate the motion to less than 6 DOF or fully measure the spatial motion are identified. These include electrical linkage methods, radiographic and video techniques, fluoroscopic techniques and electromagnetic devices. In those cases where the full spatial motion is measured, the data are available to describe the motion in simpler terms (or with less DOF) than three rotations with three translations. This is necessary for clinical application and to facilitate communication between the clinician and the engineer. </P>",

         "<P>We report a study that developed algorithms to measure the dimension and uncertainty range of free space inside the knee joint for the purpose of minimally invasive surgery. During knee arthroscopy, the patient's leg position is continuously adjusted to create the space for surgical instruments inside the joint. Surgeons 'feel' the force they apply to the leg and estimate the joint space from a 2D video. In many cases, they overestimate the instrument gap, resulting in damaging to the knee joint by pushing instruments through a gap that is too small. We used cadaveric experiments to inform the noise induced by the sensors and image processing steps, to derive an error point-cloud in a simulated environment. From the point-cloud, we calculate the instrument gap range inside the knee joint. For a selected surgical instrument gap size, the measurement algorithm is accurate to less than a millimetre. However, measurement errors introduce an uncertainty of 14%. The performance of our algorithms demonstrates the use of a single-lens arthroscope to measure the instrument gap to provide feedback to a surgeon or enable control of a robotic leg manipulator.</P>",

A large number of studies have attempted to estimate forces around the knee during various activities. Several approaches have been used to relate knee kinematics and external forces to internal joint contact forces, the most popular being inverse dynamics, forward dynamics, and static body analyses. Knee forces have also been measured in vivo after knee arthroplasty, which serves as valuable validation of computational predictions. This review summarizes the results of published studies that measured knee forces for various activities. The efficacy of various methods to alter knee force distribution, such as gait modification, orthotics, walking aids, and custom treadmills are analyzed. Current gaps in our knowledge are identified and directions for future research in this area are outlined. </P>",

         "<P>In osteoarthritis, magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice to image articular cartilage and 'bone marrow lesions.' However, the calcified cartilage, the subchondral bone plate, and trabecular subchondral bone that are mineralized tissues strongly attenuate X-rays and are therefore potentially accessible for analyses using computed tomography (CT). CT images nicely show osseous cardinal signs of advanced osteoarthritis such as osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and subchondral bone sclerosis. But more importantly, CT can help us to better understand the pathophysiology of knee osteoarthritis from the measurement of the density and structure of subchondral mineralized tissues in vivo. For that purpose, we recently developed dedicated image analysis software called Medical Image Analysis Framework (MIAF)-Knee. In this manuscript, our aims are to present current knowledge on CT imaging of the subchondral bone in knee osteoarthritis and to provide a brief introduction to basic technical aspects of MIAF-Knee as well as preliminary results we obtained in patients with knee osteoarthritis as compared to control subjects.</P>",

         "<P>In the field of knee imaging, the incorporation of MR-based pseudo-CT synthesis holds the potential to mitigate the need for separate CT scans, simplifying workflows, enhancing patient comfort, and reducing radiation exposure. In this work, we present a novel DL framework, grounded in the development of the Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) method, tailored specifically for the synthesis of pseudo-CT images in knee imaging to surmount the limitations of current methods. Upon visually examining the outcomes, it is evident that the synthesized pseudo-CTs show an excellent quality and high robustness. Despite the limited dataset employed, the method is able to capture the particularities of the bone contours in the resulting image. The experimental Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Zero-Normalized Cross Correlation (ZNCC), Mutual Information (MI), Relative Change (RC), and absolute Relative Change (|RC|) report values of 30.4638 ± 7.4770, 28.1168 ± 1.5245, 0.9230 ± 0.0217, 0.9807 ± 0.0071, 0.8548 ± 0.1019, 0.0055 ± 0.0265, and 0.0302 ± 0.0218 (median ± median absolute deviation), respectively. The voxel-by-voxel correlation plot shows an excellent correlation between pseudo-CT and ground-truth CT Hounsfield units (m = 0.9785; adjusted R2 = 0.9988; &rho; = 0.9849; p < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plot shows that the average of the differences is low ((HUCT&#x2212;HUpseudo&#x2212;CT = 0.7199 ± 35.2490; 95% confidence interval [&#x2212;68.3681, 69.8079]).

Three fresh cadaver knees were imaged at 6 flexion angles between 0&#x00B0; and 120&#x00B0; by MRI, a combination of RSA and CT and 3D digitisation (in two knees). Virtual models of all 42 positions were created using suitable computer software. Each virtual model was aligned to a newly defined anatomically based Cartesian coordinate system. The angular rotations around the 3 coordinate system axes were calculated directly from the aligned virtual models using rigid body kinematics and found to be equally accurate for the 3 methods. The 3 rotations in each knee could be depicted using anatomy-based diagrams for all 3 methods. We conclude that the 3 methods of data acquisition are equally and adequately accurate in vitro. MRI may be the most useful in vivo.</P>",

         "<P>PURPOSE: To compare magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR arthrography with computed tomography (CT) and CT arthrography in the detection of intraarticular bodies in the knee. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cuboid (3- or 6-mm-long sides) osseous and cartilaginous bodies were implanted in 16 cadaveric knee specimens. MR imaging was performed with T1-weighted spin-echo (SE), T2-weighted SE, proton-density-weighted SE, gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS), and spoiled GRASS sequences. MR arthrography was performed in two phases with saline and 2 mmol/L gadopentetate dimeglumine. CT and CT arthrography were performed in the transaxial plane. RESULTS: MR arthrography yielded the highest accuracy for the detection of osseous and cartilaginous bodies combined (92%) and was significantly (P < .01) better than MR imaging (57%-70%), CT arthrography (80%), and CT (74%). Accuracy of CT arthrography was significantly better than that of MR imaging and that of CT. Accuracy of saline-enhanced MR arthrography was significantly inferior (P < .001) to that of gadolinium-enhanced MR arthrography. CONCLUSION: MR arthrography is the best imaging technique for detection of individual intraarticular bodies. CT arthrography is the second most accurate method. Spoiled GRASS and T2-weighted SE sequences are the most accurate at MR imaging. The presence of intraarticular fluid and performance of saline-enhanced MR arthrography improve detectability of intraarticular bodies.</P>",

There were 11 men and one woman, 25&ndash;82 years of age (mean age 48 years). Four patients did not have a documented history of gout at the time of the MR examination. The diagnosis of intra-articular tophi was provided by arthroscopy and histological examination (5 patients), by microscopic study of joint fluid (5 patients), or by characteristic clinical, laboratory and imaging findings (2 patients). <I>Results.</I> In 15 MR examinations the tophi were located purely intra-articularly in 10 knees. In the remaining five MR studies, periarticular soft tissues or bone, or both, were involved. All the intra-articular tophi manifested low to intermediate signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. All five Gd-enhanced MR examinations demonstrated a heterogeneous peripheral enhancement. All 10 CT scans showed varying degrees of stippled calcifications within the tophi. The nature of the calcifications was confirmed on histological examination in three patients. <I>Conclusion.</I> Presenting clinical manifestations of gout may relate to intra-articular tophaceous deposits. Such deposits present as masses on MR images with low to intermediate signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images and a characteristic enhancement pattern following intravenous Gd administration. These features relate primarily to internal calcifications, which are most evident on CT images. MR evaluation (including Gd administration) supplemented, in some cases, with CT scanning allows accurate diagnosis of intra-articular tophaceous deposits.</P>",

Two-and three-dimensional images were used for displaying in all cases by means of MPR and VRT. Results The all tendons and partial ligaments of 24 knees, such as patella ligament, fibular collateral ligament, anterior curciate ligament （ACL） and posterior curciate ligament （PCL） were clearly displayed; the tibial collateral ligament was not displayed satisfactorily. The transversal ligaments, such as lateral patellar retinaculum and medial patellar retinaculum, and the posterior ligament, such as oblique popliteal ligament could not be showed clearly. Conclusion The dual-energy CT was a new and valuable tool to display the main ligaments of the knee.",

         "<P>PURPOSE: To assess dual-detector spiral CT arthrography in the evaluation of the entire knee cartilage obtained from cadavers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two independent observers characterized articular cartilage in 12 cadaver knees in which MR imaging and dual-detector spiral CT arthrography were performed and compared their findings to those found during macroscopic assessment. The sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging and spiral CT arthrography for detecting grade 2A or higher and grade 2B or higher cartilage lesions, the Spearman correlation coefficient between arthrographic and macroscopic grading, and kappa statistics for assessing interobserver reproducibility were determined. RESULTS: At spiral CT arthrography, sensitivities and specificities ranged between 80% and 88% for the detection of grade 2A or higher cartilage lesions and ranged between 85% and 94% for the detection of grade 2B or higher cartilage lesions. At MR imaging, sensitivities and specificities ranged between 78% and 86% and between 76% and 91% for the detection of grade 2A or higher and grade 2B or higher cartilage lesions, respectively. Spearman correlation coefficients between spiral CT arthrography or MR imaging and macroscopic grading of articular surfaces were 0.797 and 0.702, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dual-detector spiral CT arthrography of the knee is a valuable method for the assessment of open cartilage lesions of the entire knee.</P>",

         "Background Preoperative templating is an important step for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), facilitating hospital personnel in the anticipation and preparation of necessary surgical resources. Despite its importance, this process currently lacks automation. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to automate implant size prediction.Methods A total of 13,281 (2938 anteroposterior, 10,343 lateral) knee radiographs obtained from the authors’ institute were utilized for model training, with 2302 (1034 anteroposterior, 1268 lateral) images set apart for validation and testing.The templating AI model integrates a pipeline composed of multiple steps for automated implant size estimation.To predict implant size, anterioposterior (AP) and lateral radiograph predictions were merged, selecting the smaller of the predicted sizes to prevent implant overhang. The model’s size predictions were validated with 81 real TKA data set apart from the training data, and its accuracy was compared to that of manual templating by an orthopedic specialist. Predictions matching the actual implanted sizes were labeled “exact” and those within one size, “accurate.” The influence of patient characteristics on the model’s prediction accuracy was also analyzed. The measurement time elapsed for implant sizing was recorded for both the AI model and the orthopedic specialist. Implant position predicted by the model was validated by comparing insert locations with postoperative images.Results Compared with data from 81 actual TKA procedures, the model provided exact predictions for 39.5% of femoral and 43.2% of tibial components. Allowing a one-size margin of error, 88.9% of predictions were deemed “accurate” for both components. Interobserver reliability (Cohen’s kappa) were 0.60 and 0.70 for femoral and tibial implants, respectively, both classified as “substantial.” The orthopedic specialist produced results accurate within one-size margin of error in 95.1% and 100% of cases for femoral and tibial components, respectively. Interobserver reliability between the orthopedic specialist and ground truth was 0.76 and 0.8 for femoral and tibial components, respectively.The measurement time per case was 48.7 s for the AI model, compared with 97.5 s for the orthopedic specialist. Compared with postoperative radiographs, predicted implant position had an error of less than 4 mm on average.Conclusions An AI-based templating tool for TKA was successfully developed, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. Its application could significantly reduce the clinical workload in TKA preparation.",

         "<P>To overcome the dilemma in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) revision caused by the degeneration of knee articular osteochondral tissue in the untreated compartment, this paper presents and validates a reliable system to evaluate which osteoarthritis patients may suffer revision after having UKA. We conducted a retrospective cohort study by collecting all revision cases available (n &#x003D; 1) and randomly selecting 74 UKA cases to keep the revision prevalence of almost 14&#x0025;. The finite element method was first applied to calculate the strain biomechanical features. We then simulated strains of each tissue node induced by the contact force during gait for five movement points through the stance phase of walking. The biological factors such as C-reactive protein and patient&#x2019;s behaviors such as pre- and post-operative maximum strains change during gait, body mass index (BMI), and age were combined and analyzed with the kernel least mean square (KLMS) method. These data were used to model the relationships among the biomechanical, biological factor, and patient&#x2019;s behaviors to predict the risk of UKA revision. The five-fold cross-validation was conducted to assess the prediction accuracy. As a result, the average prediction accuracy for correctly predicting UKA revision was 90.69&#x0025; for all cases, providing substantial evidence that this model can serve as a potential tool in decision-making for UKA surgical planning. Although knee cartilage micro-degeneration cannot be measured directly <I>in vivo</I> to evaluate the risk of UKA revision, the process can be estimated by combining biomechanical, biological factor, and patient&#x2019;s behaviors in a statistical learning model.</P>",

         "Knee forces are highly relevant to performance after total knee arthroplasty especially during high flexion activities such as squatting. We constructed subject-specific models of two patients implanted with instrumented knee prostheses that measured knee forces in vivo. In vivo peak forces ranged from 2.2 to 2.3 times bodyweight but peaked at different flexion angles based on the type of squatting activity. Our model predicted tibiofemoral contact force with reasonable accuracy in both subjects. This model can be a very useful tool to predict the effect of surgical techniques and component alignment on contact forces. In addition, this model could be used for implant design development, to enhance knee function, to predict forces generated during other activities, and for predicting clinical outcomes.",

However, such procedures can affect the surgeon&rsquo;s ability to properly place and orient the prosthetic components on the bones.

This defined the passive motion of the joint. The effects of external load, muscle activity and variations in component placement or size were superimposed.</P><P>Component mal-placement or in-appropriate size resulted in stretched/slackened ligaments, influenced the relative positions of bones, and affected joint laxity.

An in vivo animal model was developed to test the efficacy of innovative therapies for the prevention of biomaterial centered infections caused by methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> bacteria (MRSA). Twenty-two New Zealand White rabbits were used in this study. After proper anesthesia, a stainless-steel screw with a high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) washer was cemented in a defect created in the intra-articular, non-articulating portion of the lateral femoral condyle of each knee. After closure of the joint capsule, each knee was inoculated with 0, 10<SUP>2</SUP>, 10<SUP>3</SUP>, or 10<SUP>4</SUP> colony forming units (CFU) of MRSA. Animals were sacrificed after 7days at which time joint aspirate, tissues and biomaterial samples were examined for evidence of infection.</P><P>A total of 42 knees were used for analysis. When saline was injected into the knee, 0/10 of the knees demonstrated evidence of biomaterial centered infection (with the contralateral knee receiving 10<SUP>4</SUP>CFU MRSA). Four of 10 knees developed a biomaterial centered infection when 10<SUP>2</SUP>CFU MRSA was introduced. Seven out of 10 knees developed a biomaterial centered infection when either 10<SUP>3</SUP> or 10<SUP>4</SUP>CFU MRSA was injected. No evidence of septicemia (positive blood cultures) was found in any animal. This rabbit knee model utilizes commonly employed inexpensive orthopaedic implant materials in an in vivo milieu and provides an effective method for the evaluation of treatments for biomaterial centered infections.</P>",

         "<P><B>Objective</B></P><P>This study aimed to explore the main risk factors affecting Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) patients and develop a predictive nomogram of hospital stay.</P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P>In total, 2,622 patients undergoing TKA in Singapore were included in this retrospective cohort study. Hospital extension was defined based on the 75% quartile (Q3) of hospital stay. We randomly divided all patients into two groups using a 7:3 ratio of training and validation groups. We performed univariate analyses of the training group, in which variables with <I>P</I>-values < 0.05 were included and then subjected to multivariate analysis. The multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to build a predicting nomogram, using variable <I>P</I>-values < 0.01. To evaluate the prediction ability of the model, we calculated the C-index. The ROC, Calibration, and DCA curves were drawn to assess the model. Finally, we verified the accuracy of the model using the validation group and by also using the C-index. The ROC curve, Calibration curve, and DCA curve were then applied to evaluate the model in the validation group.</P><P><B>Results</B></P><P>The final study included 2,266 patients. The 75% quartile (Q3) of hospital stay was six days. In total, 457 (20.17%) patients had hospital extensions. There were 1,588 patients in the training group and 678 patients in the validation group. Age, Hb, D.M., Operation Duration, Procedure Description, Day of Operation, Repeat Operation, and Blood Transfusion were used to build the prediction model. The C-index was 0.680 (95% CI: 0.734&#x2013;0.626) in the training group and 0.710 (95% CI: 0.742&#x2013;0.678) for the validation set. The calibration curve and DCA indicated that the hospital stay extension model showed good performance in the training and validation groups.</P><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P>To identify patients' risk factors early, medical teams need to plan a patient&rsquo;s rehabilitation path as a whole. Its advantages lie in better resource allocation, maximizing medical resources, improving the functional recovery of patients, and reducing the overall cost of hospital stay and surgery, and will help clinicians in the future.</P>",

         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P><B>Background</B></P> <P>As the number of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures continues to rise in the context of bundled payment models, patients dissatisfied postoperatively that require additional care will impose additional cost to the healthcare system. The purpose of this study is to internally validate a predictive model for postoperative patient satisfaction after TKA.</P>   <P><B>Methods</B></P> <P>In total, 484 consecutive primary TKA patients between January 2014 and January 2016 were included. Patients were stratified into 4 risk tiers based on scores of a retrospectively applied, 11-component novel knee survey for postoperative satisfaction: low risk (>96.5), mild risk (75-96.4), moderate risk (60-74.9), and high risk (<60). Binary logistic and multivariate linear regression models were constructed to determine whether the survey was predictive of satisfaction. A receiver operator curve was constructed to determine a threshold score below which patients were likely to experience postoperative dissatisfaction.</P>   <P><B>Results</B></P> <P>The mean (&plusmn;standard deviation) age was 66.3 &plusmn; 9.2 years (range 31.7-100.1) and mean body mass index was 34.2 &plusmn; 8.2 kg/m<SUP>2</SUP> (range 16.2-68.4). A knee survey score of 96.5 conferred a 97.5% sensitivity and 95.7% negative predictive value for satisfaction. Patients with higher knee survey scores had greater odds (odds ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.06, <I>P</I> = .003) of postoperative satisfaction. Increasing risk tier was significantly associated with decreased satisfaction (low risk 95.7%, mild risk 93.8%, moderate risk 86.4%, and high risk 80.4%; <I>P</I> = .007). The knee survey was not significantly correlated with complications (<I>r</I> = &minus;0.43, <I>P</I> = .32).</P>   <P><B>Conclusion</B></P> <P>This novel knee survey conferred a 97.5% sensitivity and 95.7% negative predictive value in identifying at-risk patients for postoperative dissatisfaction after primary TKA.</P>",

Since in vivo measurement of knee prosthetic articulation is almost impossible, we created a 3D mathematical model consisted of the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral compartments of artificial knee joint. As the model could reproduce the comprehensive and sophisticated motion of a knee prosthesis, it is possible to generate and analyze various walking conditions with various types of knee prostheses and hence reproduce joint rotation mismatch, excessive deviation of contact points and a loft-off between the medio and lateral sides of the joint.</P>",

         "<P>Over the past few years, osteoarthritis is one of the most common knee diseases. The diagnosis and treatment of this disease is a vital importance. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown a good performance in learning the high-level features and in resolving segmentation issues. In this paper, we propose a new model of DL 3D-Res-UNet in order to accurately segment the knee cartilage from a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3D construction that allows perfectly visualizing the anatomical structure of this organ. This model is a combination of an architecture widely known in the literature for its segmentation efficiency (3D-UNet) with a residual architecture (3D-ResNet). The experimental results reveal that the suggested model can stabilize the training model, segment the cartilage from MRI very well and compete with the state of art on multiple performance metrics. The gain of precision and recall with 3DRes-UNet is given up to 15% and 26% compared to 3D-ResNet and 3D-UNet, respectively, hence the effectiveness of the suggested method.</P>",

         "<P>The statistical shape model (SSM) method that uses 2D images of the knee joint to predict the three-dimensional (3D) joint surface model has been reported in the literature. In this study, we constructed a SSM database using 152 human computed tomography (CT) knee joint models, including the femur, tibia and patella and analysed the characteristics of each principal component of the SSM. The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation). The computational time for each bone of the knee joint was within 30?s using a personal computer. The analysis of this study indicated that the SSM method could be a useful tool to construct 3D surface models of the knee with sub-millimeter accuracy in real time. Thus, it may have a broad application in computer-assisted knee surgeries that require 3D surface models of the knee.</P>",

This method is a first step towards automation of prosthesis placement. Thanks to the mathematically computed four-bar mechanism, it is now possible to emulate the implant insertion before the operation. This model allows the surgeon to fit the prosthesis to the patient&#x2019;s knee and to verify if the mounted position is optimal. This process can be repeated until the ideal position is found. Exact copies of the bones are made from the CT images of the patient. These resin copies of the real bones are placed in the motion model, reproducing the real patient&#x2019;s knee flexion. The model shows the implantation result with respect to the operation plan and the patient&#x2019;s kinematics. The experiment carried out on a patient&#x2019;s model according to the standard implantation shows a lift-off and sliding effect of the femoral component outside the joint area. However, this phenomenon is easily resolved if the femoral component is implanted about half a centimeter lateral to the knee&#x2019;s coronal axis. Until now, no medical research had questioned the lateral positioning of the prosthesis. This knee model provides an understanding of the important biomechanical parameters for total knee replacement surgery. This model will have a significant contribution to secure the surgery&#x2019;s success, increase patient satisfaction and reduce the overall number of revisions.</P>",

         "<P>Purpose<P>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based three-dimensional analysis of knee cartilage has evolved to become fully automatic. However, when implementing these measurements across multiple clinical centers, scanner variability becomes a critical consideration. Our purposes were to quantify and compare same-model variability (between repeated scans on the same MRI system) and cross-model variability (across different MRI systems) in knee cartilage thickness measurements using MRI scanners from five manufacturers, as analyzed with a specific 3D volume analysis software.</P></P><P>Methods<P>Ten healthy volunteers (eight males and two females, aged 22-60 years) underwent two scans of their right knee on 3T MRI systems from five manufacturers (Canon, Fujifilm, GE, Philips, and Siemens). The imaging protocol included fat-suppressed spoiled gradient echo and proton density weighted sequences. Cartilage regions were automatically segmented into 7 subregions using a specific deep learning-based 3D volume analysis software. This resulted in 350 measurements for same-model variability and 2,800 measurements for cross-model variability.</P></P><P>Results<P>For same-model variability, 82% of measurements showed variability &le;0.10 mm, and 98% showed variability &le;0.20 mm. For cross-model variability, 51% showed variability &le;0.10 mm, and 84% showed variability &le;0.20 mm. The mean same-model variability (0.06 ± 0.05 mm) was significantly lower than cross-model variability (0.11 ± 0.09 mm) (p < 0.001).</P></P><P>Conclusion<P>This study demonstrates that knee cartilage thickness measurements exhibit significantly higher variability across different MRI systems compared to repeated measurements on the same system, when analyzed using this specific software. This finding has important implications for multi-center studies and longitudinal assessments using different MRI systems and highlights the software-dependent nature of such variability assessments.</P></P>",

         "<P> Knee joint implants developed by western companies have been imported to Korea and used for Korean patients. However, many clinical problems occur in knee joints of Korean patients after total knee joint replacement owing to the geometric mismatch between the western implants and Korean knee joint structures. To solve these problems, a method to determine the representative dimension parameter values of Korean knee joints is introduced to aid in the design of knee joint implants appropriate for Korean patients. Measurements of the dimension parameters of 88 male Korean knee joint subjects were carried out. The distribution of the subjects versus each measured parameter value was investigated. The measured dimension parameter values of each parameter were grouped by suitable intervals called the &ldquo;size group,&rdquo; and average values of the size groups were calculated. The knee joint subjects were grouped as the &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; based on &ldquo;size group numbers&rdquo; of each parameter. From the iterative calculations to decrease the errors between the average dimension parameter values of each &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; and the dimension parameter values of the subjects, the average dimension parameter values that give less than the error criterion were determined to be the representative dimension parameter values for designing knee joint implants for Korean patients. </P>",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Voluntary participants of 81 cases, physically normal and free from knee joint disease at present or in the past, were chosen for our research program. The subjects were divided into young, middle and old age group respectively for the male and female; and articular cartilage thickness using MRI were measured. RESULT: Each of the three groups reveals the tendency of decrease in the thickness of the knee joint cartilage in all of the age groups along with the increase of the age. The cartilage thickness according to age for both sex, except for the tibial medial condyle, decreased significantly. For the male subjects, the degree of decrease in cartilage thicknes indicates difference in each sections. However, in case of female, the change of articular cartilage thickness in overall sections showed more significantly decreased in young to middle age group than in middle to old age group. CONCLUSION: The results revealed the normal articular cartilage thickness of knee and time that the thickness of articular cartilage was decreased with age. And we could evaluate the severity of degenerative change of articular cartilage by comparison to normal articular cartilage thickness.",

         "Introduction&amp;#xD; The anterolateral ligament (ALL) has recently been thought to play an important role in the rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). However, there are still some controversies in the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL. The purpose of this study was to investigate anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL using Korean cadaveric knee joints. We investigated the effect of ALL injury on its footprint distances under various knee conditions and assessed three-dimensional functional stability tests (pivot-shift and Lachmann tests) using a noninvasive triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Materials and Methods&amp;#xD; 20 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were dissected by a single surgeon. The locations of the tibial and femoral footprints of the ALL were recorded with respect to the lateral femoral epicondyle, tip of the fibular head, and Gerdy’s tubercle. The distance between the footprints were recorded in a normal knee condition. All cadavers were tested in neutral, internal, and external rotation at 30°, 60°, 90° of knee flexion. The pivot shift and Lachmann tests were measured using a triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA). Serial sectioning of the ALL and the ACL was performed after testing in normal knee joints. Measurements were collected before and after each sectioning.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Results&amp;#xD; Anatomical features of the current study were similar to those of previous cadaveric studies. The prevalence of the ALL in our study was 100%. Average distance of the tibial footprint to the tip of the fibular head was 19.85 ± 3.41 mm and to Gerdy’s tubercle was 18.3 ± 4.19mm. Average distance of the femoral footprint to the lateral femoral epicondyle was 10.25 ± 2.97mm. The footprint distance of the ALL was the longest at 30° of knee flexion (47.83 ± 8.05 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001) in a normal knee neutral rotation condition. An internal rotational force produced statistically significant increases in footprint distances in normal knees at all three knee flexion angles. During internal rotation, the footprint distance was also the longest at 30° of knee flexion (50.05 ± 8.88 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although an internal rotational force did not produce a statistically significant increase in the footprint distance after ALL transection, it increased the footprint distance at all three knee flexion angles after a combined ACL and ALL transection (p = 0.022). After a combined ACL and ALL transection, the footprint distance was the longest at 30° of knee flexion under internal rotational force (52.05 ± 7.60 mm). Pivot shift and Lachmann tests measured by the KiRA device did not show statistically significant differences between normal and ALL-transected knees. However, there were significant differences in the combined ACL-ALL-transected knees compared with normal and ALL-transected knees (p&amp;lt;0.001).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Conclusion&amp;#xD; The ALL was identified as a distinct ligament structure in this Korean cadaveric study. Considering the footprint distances of the ALL in various knee conditions, the ALL is thought to play a protective role in internal rotational stability especially at 30° of knee flexion. Isolated ALL transection did not show significant effects on the ALL footprint distances and functional stability tests. The ALL is thought to act as a secondary supportive stabilizer for rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the ACL.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Keywords: knee joint, anterolateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament, rotatory instability, KiRA, anterolateral ligament reconstruction, Korean cadaver&amp;#xD;",

         "Three-dimensional measurement of joint motion is a promising tool for clinical evaluation and therapeutic treatment comparisons. Although many devices exist for joints kinematics assessment, there is a need for a system that could be used in routine practice. Such a system should be accurate, ambulatory, and easy to use. The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics (ISB). A simple method based on a leg movement is proposed here to align two inertial measurement units fixed on the thigh and shank segments. Based on the combination of the former alignment and a fusion algorithm, the three-dimensional knee joint angle is measured and compared with a magnetic motion capture system during walking. The proposed system is suitable to measure the absolute knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction angles with mean (SD) offset errors of -1<SUP>o</SUP> (1<SUP>o</SUP>) and 0<SUP>o</SUP> (0.6<SUP>o</SUP>) and mean (SD) root mean square (RMS) errors of 1.5<SUP>o</SUP> (0.4<SUP>o</SUP>) and 1.7<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The system is also suitable for the relative measurement of knee internal/external rotation (mean (SD) offset error of 3.4<SUP>o</SUP> (2.7<SUP>o</SUP>)) with a mean (SD) RMS error of 1.6<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The method described in this paper can be easily adapted in order to measure other joint angular displacements such as elbow or ankle.",

         "<P> Knee joint motion has been described in various ways in the literature. These are explained and commented on. Two methods for describing knee joint motion with 6 degrees of freedom (DOF)-Euler angle and the helical axis of motion-are discussed. Techniques to measure joint motion which can either approximate the motion to less than 6 DOF or fully measure the spatial motion are identified. These include electrical linkage methods, radiographic and video techniques, fluoroscopic techniques and electromagnetic devices. In those cases where the full spatial motion is measured, the data are available to describe the motion in simpler terms (or with less DOF) than three rotations with three translations. This is necessary for clinical application and to facilitate communication between the clinician and the engineer. </P>",

         "<P>We report a study that developed algorithms to measure the dimension and uncertainty range of free space inside the knee joint for the purpose of minimally invasive surgery. During knee arthroscopy, the patient's leg position is continuously adjusted to create the space for surgical instruments inside the joint. Surgeons 'feel' the force they apply to the leg and estimate the joint space from a 2D video. In many cases, they overestimate the instrument gap, resulting in damaging to the knee joint by pushing instruments through a gap that is too small. We used cadaveric experiments to inform the noise induced by the sensors and image processing steps, to derive an error point-cloud in a simulated environment. From the point-cloud, we calculate the instrument gap range inside the knee joint. For a selected surgical instrument gap size, the measurement algorithm is accurate to less than a millimetre. However, measurement errors introduce an uncertainty of 14%. The performance of our algorithms demonstrates the use of a single-lens arthroscope to measure the instrument gap to provide feedback to a surgeon or enable control of a robotic leg manipulator.</P>",

Knee forces have also been measured in vivo after knee arthroplasty, which serves as valuable validation of computational predictions. This review summarizes the results of published studies that measured knee forces for various activities. The efficacy of various methods to alter knee force distribution, such as gait modification, orthotics, walking aids, and custom treadmills are analyzed.

However, the calcified cartilage, the subchondral bone plate, and trabecular subchondral bone that are mineralized tissues strongly attenuate X-rays and are therefore potentially accessible for analyses using computed tomography (CT). CT images nicely show osseous cardinal signs of advanced osteoarthritis such as osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and subchondral bone sclerosis. But more importantly, CT can help us to better understand the pathophysiology of knee osteoarthritis from the measurement of the density and structure of subchondral mineralized tissues in vivo. For that purpose, we recently developed dedicated image analysis software called Medical Image Analysis Framework (MIAF)-Knee. In this manuscript, our aims are to present current knowledge on CT imaging of the subchondral bone in knee osteoarthritis and to provide a brief introduction to basic technical aspects of MIAF-Knee as well as preliminary results we obtained in patients with knee osteoarthritis as compared to control subjects.</P>",

In this work, we present a novel DL framework, grounded in the development of the Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) method, tailored specifically for the synthesis of pseudo-CT images in knee imaging to surmount the limitations of current methods. Upon visually examining the outcomes, it is evident that the synthesized pseudo-CTs show an excellent quality and high robustness. Despite the limited dataset employed, the method is able to capture the particularities of the bone contours in the resulting image. The experimental Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Zero-Normalized Cross Correlation (ZNCC), Mutual Information (MI), Relative Change (RC), and absolute Relative Change (|RC|) report values of 30.4638 ± 7.4770, 28.1168 ± 1.5245, 0.9230 ± 0.0217, 0.9807 ± 0.0071, 0.8548 ± 0.1019, 0.0055 ± 0.0265, and 0.0302 ± 0.0218 (median ± median absolute deviation), respectively.

Virtual models of all 42 positions were created using suitable computer software. Each virtual model was aligned to a newly defined anatomically based Cartesian coordinate system. The angular rotations around the 3 coordinate system axes were calculated directly from the aligned virtual models using rigid body kinematics and found to be equally accurate for the 3 methods.

         "<P>PURPOSE: To compare magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR arthrography with computed tomography (CT) and CT arthrography in the detection of intraarticular bodies in the knee. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cuboid (3- or 6-mm-long sides) osseous and cartilaginous bodies were implanted in 16 cadaveric knee specimens. MR imaging was performed with T1-weighted spin-echo (SE), T2-weighted SE, proton-density-weighted SE, gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS), and spoiled GRASS sequences. MR arthrography was performed in two phases with saline and 2 mmol/L gadopentetate dimeglumine. CT and CT arthrography were performed in the transaxial plane. RESULTS: MR arthrography yielded the highest accuracy for the detection of osseous and cartilaginous bodies combined (92%) and was significantly (P < .01) better than MR imaging (57%-70%), CT arthrography (80%), and CT (74%). Accuracy of CT arthrography was significantly better than that of MR imaging and that of CT. Accuracy of saline-enhanced MR arthrography was significantly inferior (P < .001) to that of gadolinium-enhanced MR arthrography. CONCLUSION: MR arthrography is the best imaging technique for detection of individual intraarticular bodies. CT arthrography is the second most accurate method. Spoiled GRASS and T2-weighted SE sequences are the most accurate at MR imaging. The presence of intraarticular fluid and performance of saline-enhanced MR arthrography improve detectability of intraarticular bodies.</P>",

         "<P>Abstract&ensp;</P><P><I>Objective.</I> To define the imaging characteristics of intra-articular tophi of the knee. <I>Design and patients.</I> Twelve patients with intra-articular tophi in the knee were studied with routine MR imaging, gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MR imaging, and CT over a 4-year period. There were 11 men and one woman, 25&ndash;82 years of age (mean age 48 years). Four patients did not have a documented history of gout at the time of the MR examination. The diagnosis of intra-articular tophi was provided by arthroscopy and histological examination (5 patients), by microscopic study of joint fluid (5 patients), or by characteristic clinical, laboratory and imaging findings (2 patients). <I>Results.</I> In 15 MR examinations the tophi were located purely intra-articularly in 10 knees. In the remaining five MR studies, periarticular soft tissues or bone, or both, were involved. All the intra-articular tophi manifested low to intermediate signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. All five Gd-enhanced MR examinations demonstrated a heterogeneous peripheral enhancement. All 10 CT scans showed varying degrees of stippled calcifications within the tophi. The nature of the calcifications was confirmed on histological examination in three patients. <I>Conclusion.</I> Presenting clinical manifestations of gout may relate to intra-articular tophaceous deposits. Such deposits present as masses on MR images with low to intermediate signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images and a characteristic enhancement pattern following intravenous Gd administration. These features relate primarily to internal calcifications, which are most evident on CT images. MR evaluation (including Gd administration) supplemented, in some cases, with CT scanning allows accurate diagnosis of intra-articular tophaceous deposits.</P>",

         "<P>PURPOSE: To assess dual-detector spiral CT arthrography in the evaluation of the entire knee cartilage obtained from cadavers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two independent observers characterized articular cartilage in 12 cadaver knees in which MR imaging and dual-detector spiral CT arthrography were performed and compared their findings to those found during macroscopic assessment. The sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging and spiral CT arthrography for detecting grade 2A or higher and grade 2B or higher cartilage lesions, the Spearman correlation coefficient between arthrographic and macroscopic grading, and kappa statistics for assessing interobserver reproducibility were determined. RESULTS: At spiral CT arthrography, sensitivities and specificities ranged between 80% and 88% for the detection of grade 2A or higher cartilage lesions and ranged between 85% and 94% for the detection of grade 2B or higher cartilage lesions. At MR imaging, sensitivities and specificities ranged between 78% and 86% and between 76% and 91% for the detection of grade 2A or higher and grade 2B or higher cartilage lesions, respectively. Spearman correlation coefficients between spiral CT arthrography or MR imaging and macroscopic grading of articular surfaces were 0.797 and 0.702, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dual-detector spiral CT arthrography of the knee is a valuable method for the assessment of open cartilage lesions of the entire knee.</P>",

         "Background Preoperative templating is an important step for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), facilitating hospital personnel in the anticipation and preparation of necessary surgical resources. Despite its importance, this process currently lacks automation. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to automate implant size prediction.Methods A total of 13,281 (2938 anteroposterior, 10,343 lateral) knee radiographs obtained from the authors’ institute were utilized for model training, with 2302 (1034 anteroposterior, 1268 lateral) images set apart for validation and testing.The templating AI model integrates a pipeline composed of multiple steps for automated implant size estimation.To predict implant size, anterioposterior (AP) and lateral radiograph predictions were merged, selecting the smaller of the predicted sizes to prevent implant overhang. The model’s size predictions were validated with 81 real TKA data set apart from the training data, and its accuracy was compared to that of manual templating by an orthopedic specialist. Predictions matching the actual implanted sizes were labeled “exact” and those within one size, “accurate.” The influence of patient characteristics on the model’s prediction accuracy was also analyzed. The measurement time elapsed for implant sizing was recorded for both the AI model and the orthopedic specialist. Implant position predicted by the model was validated by comparing insert locations with postoperative images.Results Compared with data from 81 actual TKA procedures, the model provided exact predictions for 39.5% of femoral and 43.2% of tibial components. Allowing a one-size margin of error, 88.9% of predictions were deemed “accurate” for both components. Interobserver reliability (Cohen’s kappa) were 0.60 and 0.70 for femoral and tibial implants, respectively, both classified as “substantial.” The orthopedic specialist produced results accurate within one-size margin of error in 95.1% and 100% of cases for femoral and tibial components, respectively. Interobserver reliability between the orthopedic specialist and ground truth was 0.76 and 0.8 for femoral and tibial components, respectively.The measurement time per case was 48.7 s for the AI model, compared with 97.5 s for the orthopedic specialist. Compared with postoperative radiographs, predicted implant position had an error of less than 4 mm on average.Conclusions An AI-based templating tool for TKA was successfully developed, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. Its application could significantly reduce the clinical workload in TKA preparation.",

         "<P>To overcome the dilemma in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) revision caused by the degeneration of knee articular osteochondral tissue in the untreated compartment, this paper presents and validates a reliable system to evaluate which osteoarthritis patients may suffer revision after having UKA. We conducted a retrospective cohort study by collecting all revision cases available (n &#x003D; 1) and randomly selecting 74 UKA cases to keep the revision prevalence of almost 14&#x0025;. The finite element method was first applied to calculate the strain biomechanical features. We then simulated strains of each tissue node induced by the contact force during gait for five movement points through the stance phase of walking. The biological factors such as C-reactive protein and patient&#x2019;s behaviors such as pre- and post-operative maximum strains change during gait, body mass index (BMI), and age were combined and analyzed with the kernel least mean square (KLMS) method. These data were used to model the relationships among the biomechanical, biological factor, and patient&#x2019;s behaviors to predict the risk of UKA revision. The five-fold cross-validation was conducted to assess the prediction accuracy. As a result, the average prediction accuracy for correctly predicting UKA revision was 90.69&#x0025; for all cases, providing substantial evidence that this model can serve as a potential tool in decision-making for UKA surgical planning. Although knee cartilage micro-degeneration cannot be measured directly <I>in vivo</I> to evaluate the risk of UKA revision, the process can be estimated by combining biomechanical, biological factor, and patient&#x2019;s behaviors in a statistical learning model.</P>",

We constructed subject-specific models of two patients implanted with instrumented knee prostheses that measured knee forces in vivo. In vivo peak forces ranged from 2.2 to 2.3 times bodyweight but peaked at different flexion angles based on the type of squatting activity. Our model predicted tibiofemoral contact force with reasonable accuracy in both subjects. This model can be a very useful tool to predict the effect of surgical techniques and component alignment on contact forces. In addition, this model could be used for implant design development, to enhance knee function, to predict forces generated during other activities, and for predicting clinical outcomes.",

This defined the passive motion of the joint. The effects of external load, muscle activity and variations in component placement or size were superimposed.</P><P>Component mal-placement or in-appropriate size resulted in stretched/slackened ligaments, influenced the relative positions of bones, and affected joint laxity.

An in vivo animal model was developed to test the efficacy of innovative therapies for the prevention of biomaterial centered infections caused by methicillin-resistant <I>Staphylococcus aureus</I> bacteria (MRSA). Twenty-two New Zealand White rabbits were used in this study. After proper anesthesia, a stainless-steel screw with a high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) washer was cemented in a defect created in the intra-articular, non-articulating portion of the lateral femoral condyle of each knee. After closure of the joint capsule, each knee was inoculated with 0, 10<SUP>2</SUP>, 10<SUP>3</SUP>, or 10<SUP>4</SUP> colony forming units (CFU) of MRSA. Animals were sacrificed after 7days at which time joint aspirate, tissues and biomaterial samples were examined for evidence of infection.</P><P>A total of 42 knees were used for analysis. When saline was injected into the knee, 0/10 of the knees demonstrated evidence of biomaterial centered infection (with the contralateral knee receiving 10<SUP>4</SUP>CFU MRSA). Four of 10 knees developed a biomaterial centered infection when 10<SUP>2</SUP>CFU MRSA was introduced. Seven out of 10 knees developed a biomaterial centered infection when either 10<SUP>3</SUP> or 10<SUP>4</SUP>CFU MRSA was injected. No evidence of septicemia (positive blood cultures) was found in any animal. This rabbit knee model utilizes commonly employed inexpensive orthopaedic implant materials in an in vivo milieu and provides an effective method for the evaluation of treatments for biomaterial centered infections.</P>",
