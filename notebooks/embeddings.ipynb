         "BACKGROUND: 'Architectural Urbanism: Melbourne/Seoul' was a two-city exhibition funded by RMIT University and the Korean National University, supported by the Australian Government through the Australian International Cultural Council. Kerstin Thompson Architecture (KTA) showed five works - Carrum Downs Police Station, MUMA Gallery, Lake Conneware House, Napier Street Housing and Royal Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre - as one of ten architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected to exhibit. The exhibited work included large scale photographs, working drawings and exegetical text. CONTRIBUTION: The exhibition explored architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. Within this context, the public projects exhibited by KTA explore relationships between interior and exterior, building and street, and the existing and the new. This draws on Thompson's ongoing practice a"

These projects were selected for exhibition in the reciprocal international Seoul/Melbourne exhibition, 'Architectural Urbanism'. Baracco + Wright was one of ten young architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected for inclusion in the event. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Exhibition curator Melanie Dodd said 'Architectural Urbanism' would explore architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. The 4 selected works by B+W exemplify this approach, by sharing common ground which transcends their formal differences because of how they play with the threshold and boundaries of urban site conditions as a mean"

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Urban Box was one of 4 projects by Iredale Pedersen Hook (IPH) selected for exhibition in the reciprocal international Seoul/Melbourne exhibition, 'Architectural Urbanism' (the others were Sheep House, Grace Park House and Innocent Bystander winery). IPH was one of 10 firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) who participated. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Urban Box is a solid little building in Port Melbourne, an inner-city Melbourne suburb of single-fronted timber Victorian workers cottages, high-rise apartments, public housing and light industry. It is the prototype of a collection of small houses by IPH that uses the insulated concrete sandwich precast panel system, Thermomass. The site is 99m2; the subdivision of an already small piece of land. The house shifts the typology of infill housing towards a responsive and sustainable approach with a sense of material quality. Programmed 'upside-down', the bedrooms and bathrooms are on the ground floor and the living spaces an"

The work contributes to Urban Design, specifically exploring evolutionary adaptation of contemporary Australian urban typologies. The work contributes to the areas of research being undertaken by among others, Kristine Sampson, Christopher M. Lee, Series Architects & Tom Verebes. CONTRIBUTION In order to explore the curatorial proposition of the Now&When exhibition; to imagine the future of Australian urban environments, the Saturation City project manufactured a crisis - a rise in sea level of 20m, tested around Melbourne and Port Philip Bay.

The project was conceived to be cumulative and comparative as it travelled to three Asian cities; local images were added in Beijing to those collected in previous exhibitions in Seoul and Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: This work builds upon research in bottom-up or micro-urbanism strategies in the Asian city. It develops observational and participatory techniques to enable the general public to engage with urban design issues by contributing to the exhibition with text and images. This work marks a significant shift within Asia. Instead of looking to the West for solutions to contemporary urban design issues, this research proposes that Asia is now providing more appropriate models to deal with the complexi"

         "BACKGROUND: The K2K design proposal, developed by JMD Design (the practice of Anton James) in collaboration with Hill Thallis, and Bennet and Trimble, won the K2K Urban Design Competition in 2016. The competition was run by Randwick City Council, which invited the world's best architects, planners and urbanists to imagine a sustainable and innovative vision for the future of Kensington and Kingsford Town Centres. CONTRIBUTION: The K2K corridor sits within an ancient landscape and water system that ran from Centennial Park to Botany Bay. The Millstream, the most enduring trace of this system, runs parallel to Doncaster Avenue. Over the past century it has been capped and canalised, its primacy in the landscape superseded by the grand axis of Anzac Parade. The proposal that JMD collaborated on invests in the ancient system and reveals it as a complementary figure to Anzac Parade. Combining enhanced public open space and water management, together these initiatives define a new and highly"

The exhibited component focussed upon the design of the site as a contribution to the discourse on environmental sustainability through an innovative design of the site. It was exhibited in X-Field Archive (also co-curated by the researcher), the final iteration of an international travelling exhibition that began in Melbourne in 2010 and went to Seoul, Beijing and Taipei. Black was one of six Melbourne practitioners included in the show. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: In response to the curatorial theme Preparing the Ground, the exhibit focussed upon the carved ground of the site. This concept brings a building into relationship with its site - so that external and internal environments form an integral whole. A series of new levels, terraces, spaces and edges were defined and then echoed in the crafting of the volume of the house and studio. This process was reflec"

         "This paper begins by situating the large screen in Melbourne as part of the industrial cluster development of the Southbank cultural precinct. It examines urban regeneration and cultural policies to map the politics of its spatial geography of agglomeration. It further explores the role of networked screen in the formation of a transnational creative cluster. Using a telematic large screen event staged across Melbourne and Seoul, the paper evaluates the responses of audiences to examine the politics of cultural and civic engagement. While scholarships on creative clusters predominantly focus on the new value chain of industrial and commercial production that arises as a result of agglomeration, this paper argues that the large screen possesses the capacity not only to invigorate public participation, but as a transnational creative cluster, the networked large screen also possesses the potential to enhance the quality of intercultural communication between Asia and Australia."

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Mobile Landscapes (III) was developed as a new key project for the curatorial theme 'Ephemeral Architectures' for the X-Field Archive (as part of the exhibition Neighbouring Effect, Seoul, Korea, and for subsequent iterations). Mobile Landscapes is a mapping of the Murray River, building upon several years of archival research of its flood histories. It comprises: a line drawing of the 2500-kilometre river system (15 A4 sheets of drafting film), and 15 photographic recordings (each A6 format) of a 24 kilometre walk undertaken (in 2001) across the '1956 floodplain'. The line drawing shows the existing river, the shoreline of a 1:100 year flood event (1956) and the survey grids of existing river towns. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The major contribution is within the scholarship of site studies in architecture, and has particular relevance as an approach to uncovering invisible site histories.

It was decided that the design should be at once simple and raw, that it would exploit the potential of the existing building and leave nothing to waste. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION The as-found condition of the space of the old department store was strong and stripped back, with four-metre high concrete ceilings, a very deep plan, and a series of large civic-scale windows overlooking Swanston and Bourke Streets. The new plan establishes an even field of workstations for the required eighty people. The aim was to clarify something about the nature of the space, and to touch as little as possible of its existing condition. Everyone is seated to be aligned with one of the large windows, which means they are also aligned with the structural bay and exposed beams above.

RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Through this project, ARM aimed to celebrate the tradition of great libraries, create an ambitious, future-oriented building, and design an organic structure that lets the natural world penetrate the interior. The building inhabits both the past and the future. Its form pays homage to the ideals of self-improvement, knowledge and curiosity expressed in the domes of great reading rooms such as the State Library of Victoria.

Its purpose was to reconnect a severed historical rail and horse trail, and to mark a civic presence along that highway as an entry to metropolitan Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION This design for a bridge asks two questions; first: how can objects of infrastructure be integrated into their physical environment? Second: how can that object activate an interior akin to architectural space? The design unites research fields of architectural design, landscape architecture, urbanism, and engineering. Works of this type often suffer from their hybridity. In contrast, this design brings a consideration of architectural space to a program that is often treated like a road. The project's enveloping mesh skin aimed to capture a relationship with the trees and topography of its surrounding, while also providing a degree of enclosure that"

It is an outstanding heritage response to an important civic and heritage place of architectural, social and cultural significance. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: ARM's underlying task was to repair Hamer Hall's standing as a major civic building and make it a 21st-century venue. The building represents two artistic discourses in Melbourne: the architectural story of the castle and the mine: the theatrical story of the palace and the cave of jewels.

         "BACKGROUND: 'Architectural Urbanism: Melbourne/Seoul' was a two-city exhibition funded by RMIT University and the Korean National University, supported by the Australian Government through the Australian International Cultural Council. Kerstin Thompson Architecture (KTA) showed five works - Carrum Downs Police Station, MUMA Gallery, Lake Conneware House, Napier Street Housing and Royal Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre - as one of ten architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected to exhibit. The exhibited work included large scale photographs, working drawings and exegetical text. CONTRIBUTION: The exhibition explored architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. Within this context, the public projects exhibited by KTA explore relationships between interior and exterior, building and street, and the existing and the new. This draws on Thompson's ongoing practice a"

These projects were selected for exhibition in the reciprocal international Seoul/Melbourne exhibition, 'Architectural Urbanism'. Baracco + Wright was one of ten young architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected for inclusion in the event. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Exhibition curator Melanie Dodd said 'Architectural Urbanism' would explore architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. The 4 selected works by B+W exemplify this approach, by sharing common ground which transcends their formal differences because of how they play with the threshold and boundaries of urban site conditions as a mean"

Since sustainability is linked to public values, research on sustainable public spaces is an important way to secure sustainability in cities. Based on this, we analyzed the sustainability of European cities by examining the design methods of public architecture according to the region. The aim of the study is to derive architectural methodology corresponding to local characteristics, and to suggest issues to consider in public architecture design to promote urban sustainability based on this. First, regarding the environmental aspect, it can be observed that there is an effort to secure sustainability. Second, in terms of social sustainability, historical value remains as a trace of architectural place, so that it continues in people&rsquo;s memory.

The square is part of the $290 million Revitalising Central Dandenong project. It opened in March 2014. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: 'Alterations', the ground pattern for the new Civic Square is a translation of topographical, clothing and locally-sourced patterns into a design that reconfigures the local ground as a giant body in motion or choreography. The name refers to the work of local tailors. The project develops and extends Paul Carter's research on how to historicise public space.

It was decided that the design should be at once simple and raw, that it would exploit the potential of the existing building and leave nothing to waste. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION The as-found condition of the space of the old department store was strong and stripped back, with four-metre high concrete ceilings, a very deep plan, and a series of large civic-scale windows overlooking Swanston and Bourke Streets. The new plan establishes an even field of workstations for the required eighty people. The aim was to clarify something about the nature of the space, and to touch as little as possible of its existing condition. Everyone is seated to be aligned with one of the large windows, which means they are also aligned with the structural bay and exposed beams above. This simple meter means that desks are a bit further apa"

The article examines the processes of urban reconstruction and architectural reconfigurations in the city as “frontier urbanism”, building on Wendy Pullan’s (2011) discussion of how various actors employ architectural and place-making practices to secure the state in contested urban space. The article traces Rijeka/Fiume´s urban development as a window of fixating state identities in the built environment throughout the century, focusing on the aftermath of the Second World War. It examines the urban transformations of the city as the demographic landscape was reshaped after the departure of the local Italian-speaking majority and the arrival of workers from various parts of Yugoslavia, but "

Mobile Landscapes is a mapping of the Murray River, building upon several years of archival research of its flood histories. It comprises: a line drawing of the 2500-kilometre river system (15 A4 sheets of drafting film), and 15 photographic recordings (each A6 format) of a 24 kilometre walk undertaken (in 2001) across the '1956 floodplain'. The line drawing shows the existing river, the shoreline of a 1:100 year flood event (1956) and the survey grids of existing river towns. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The major contribution is within the scholarship of site studies in architecture, and has particular relevance as an approach to uncovering invisible site histories.

The competition was run by Randwick City Council, which invited the world's best architects, planners and urbanists to imagine a sustainable and innovative vision for the future of Kensington and Kingsford Town Centres. CONTRIBUTION: The K2K corridor sits within an ancient landscape and water system that ran from Centennial Park to Botany Bay. The Millstream, the most enduring trace of this system, runs parallel to Doncaster Avenue. Over the past century it has been capped and canalised, its primacy in the landscape superseded by the grand axis of Anzac Parade. The proposal that JMD collaborated on invests in the ancient system and reveals it as a complementary figure to Anzac Parade. Combining enhanced public open space and water management, together these initiatives define a new and highly"

In rare instances, it has been possible to create architecture specifically to foster IE, as in the &ldquo;tri-faith&rdquo; Abrahamic campus in Omaha and the Berlin House of One. The theme is: Here we are, accepting that we share the world. Another form of IE that deserves to attract more interest is multireligious collaboration in civic work (addressing homelessness, urban blight, illiteracy, etc.). Some adherents of the intrinsically cosmopolitan &ldquo;world&rdquo; religions are actively cosmopolitan to the extent of seeking this engagement.

         "<P> This study investigates the spatial effects of the ongoing &ldquo;decommunization&rdquo; campaign in Ukraine, a state-led attack on Soviet symbols and ideology in the urban space of the capital, Kyiv. We examine decommunization through the lens of an extensive legacy of architectural, urban design, and monumental art projects erected for the celebration of the 1500th anniversary of the city of Kyiv held in 1982. We focus on four ideological narratives and examine the outcomes of decommunization on four monuments. We find that decommunization&rsquo;s effect is limited; Communist symbolism has been annotated with Ukrainian identity symbols or neglected, not demolished. We conclude that decommunization has focused on the comparatively superficial qualities of toponomy and Lenin symbols, that the legacy of Soviet identity in Kyiv&rsquo;s cityscape is much deeper and has proved surprisingly persistent, and that the historiography of the newly independent nation of Ukraine is still in a "

Mosque architecture comprises of various elements, which adapt to the local culture where the mosque is located. As such, its presence also bears some impacts on the appearance of urban architecture. Malang city as one of the major cities in East Java has numerous rapidly developing mosque architectures, including Jami&rsquo; Great Mosque of Malang, Sabilillah Mosque, Nurul Muttaqin Mosque, Ahmad Yani Mosque, and Manarul Huda Mosque. The meaning of architectural work is also closely related to the perception of humans who observe it.

CONTRIBUTION Kosloff's research centres on how movement, gesture and abstraction translate into significance. Like Mike Parr's rolling camera, Kosloff also films as if the camera were a moving figure (John Hurrell Eye Contact Mar 2010). For her site-specific video installations with Super 8 as a medium for all 3 works Kosloff exploits its capacity for articulating a particular pace and movement in monochrome removing the specificity of time and place (You wonder if these people are still alive now, but of course probably they are, very much so Hurrell.

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: The 'Urban Still Life (with mops and brooms): Beijing version' installation depicted an informal occupation of the public realm that lies outside of ownership and traditional property lines, and blurs the edges between public and private, civic and domestic. The project was conceived to be cumulative and comparative as it travelled to three Asian cities; local images were added in Beijing to those collected in previous exhibitions in Seoul and Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: This work builds upon research in bottom-up or micro-urbanism strategies in the Asian city. It develops observational and participatory techniques to enable the general public to engage with urban design issues by contributing to the exhibition with text and images. This work marks a significant shift within Asia. Instead of looking to the West for solutions to contemporary urban design issues, this research proposes that Asia is now providing more appropriate models to deal with the complexi"

Kerstin Thompson Architecture (KTA) showed five works - Carrum Downs Police Station, MUMA Gallery, Lake Conneware House, Napier Street Housing and Royal Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre - as one of ten architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected to exhibit. The exhibited work included large scale photographs, working drawings and exegetical text. CONTRIBUTION: The exhibition explored architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. Within this context, the public projects exhibited by KTA explore relationships between interior and exterior, building and street, and the existing and the new.

These projects were selected for exhibition in the reciprocal international Seoul/Melbourne exhibition, 'Architectural Urbanism'. Baracco + Wright was one of ten young architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected for inclusion in the event. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Exhibition curator Melanie Dodd said 'Architectural Urbanism' would explore architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. The 4 selected works by B+W exemplify this approach, by sharing common ground which transcends their formal differences because of how they play with the threshold and boundaries of urban site conditions as a mean"

IPH was one of 10 firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) who participated. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Urban Box is a solid little building in Port Melbourne, an inner-city Melbourne suburb of single-fronted timber Victorian workers cottages, high-rise apartments, public housing and light industry. It is the prototype of a collection of small houses by IPH that uses the insulated concrete sandwich precast panel system, Thermomass. The site is 99m2; the subdivision of an already small piece of land. The house shifts the typology of infill housing towards a responsive and sustainable approach with a sense of material quality. Programmed 'upside-down', the bedrooms and bathrooms are on the ground floor and the living spaces an"

The work contributes to Urban Design, specifically exploring evolutionary adaptation of contemporary Australian urban typologies. The work contributes to the areas of research being undertaken by among others, Kristine Sampson, Christopher M. Lee, Series Architects & Tom Verebes. CONTRIBUTION In order to explore the curatorial proposition of the Now&When exhibition; to imagine the future of Australian urban environments, the Saturation City project manufactured a crisis - a rise in sea level of 20m, tested around Melbourne and Port Philip Bay. Four key Australian urban typologies; the park/garden, the CBD, the suburb and the coastline, were subjected to dramatic densifications in response to the 'flood', acknowledging that future urbanism with be informed by existing models and modified b"

The project was conceived to be cumulative and comparative as it travelled to three Asian cities; local images were added in Beijing to those collected in previous exhibitions in Seoul and Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: This work builds upon research in bottom-up or micro-urbanism strategies in the Asian city. It develops observational and participatory techniques to enable the general public to engage with urban design issues by contributing to the exhibition with text and images. This work marks a significant shift within Asia. Instead of looking to the West for solutions to contemporary urban design issues, this research proposes that Asia is now providing more appropriate models to deal with the complexi"

The exhibited component focussed upon the design of the site as a contribution to the discourse on environmental sustainability through an innovative design of the site. It was exhibited in X-Field Archive (also co-curated by the researcher), the final iteration of an international travelling exhibition that began in Melbourne in 2010 and went to Seoul, Beijing and Taipei. Black was one of six Melbourne practitioners included in the show. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: In response to the curatorial theme Preparing the Ground, the exhibit focussed upon the carved ground of the site. This concept brings a building into relationship with its site - so that external and internal environments form an integral whole. A series of new levels, terraces, spaces and edges were defined and then echoed in the crafting of the volume of the house and studio. This process was reflec"

Its purpose was to reconnect a severed historical rail and horse trail, and to mark a civic presence along that highway as an entry to metropolitan Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION This design for a bridge asks two questions; first: how can objects of infrastructure be integrated into their physical environment? Second: how can that object activate an interior akin to architectural space? The design unites research fields of architectural design, landscape architecture, urbanism, and engineering. Works of this type often suffer from their hybridity. In contrast, this design brings a consideration of architectural space to a program that is often treated like a road. The project's enveloping mesh skin aimed to capture a relationship with the trees and topography of its surrounding, while also providing a degree of enclosure that"

         "This paper begins by situating the large screen in Melbourne as part of the industrial cluster development of the Southbank cultural precinct. It examines urban regeneration and cultural policies to map the politics of its spatial geography of agglomeration. It further explores the role of networked screen in the formation of a transnational creative cluster. Using a telematic large screen event staged across Melbourne and Seoul, the paper evaluates the responses of audiences to examine the politics of cultural and civic engagement. While scholarships on creative clusters predominantly focus on the new value chain of industrial and commercial production that arises as a result of agglomeration, this paper argues that the large screen possesses the capacity not only to invigorate public participation, but as a transnational creative cluster, the networked large screen also possesses the potential to enhance the quality of intercultural communication between Asia and Australia."

RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Through this project, ARM aimed to celebrate the tradition of great libraries, create an ambitious, future-oriented building, and design an organic structure that lets the natural world penetrate the interior. The building inhabits both the past and the future. Its form pays homage to the ideals of self-improvement, knowledge and curiosity expressed in the domes of great reading rooms such as the State Library of Victoria. It also recalls an era of great civic gestures of the 19th century - a time when domes on public buildings represented democracy, enlightenment and the arrival of civil society.

The competition was run by Randwick City Council, which invited the world's best architects, planners and urbanists to imagine a sustainable and innovative vision for the future of Kensington and Kingsford Town Centres. CONTRIBUTION: The K2K corridor sits within an ancient landscape and water system that ran from Centennial Park to Botany Bay. The Millstream, the most enduring trace of this system, runs parallel to Doncaster Avenue. Over the past century it has been capped and canalised, its primacy in the landscape superseded by the grand axis of Anzac Parade. The proposal that JMD collaborated on invests in the ancient system and reveals it as a complementary figure to Anzac Parade. Combining enhanced public open space and water management, together these initiatives define a new and highly"

The building's redevelopment by ARM in 2012 repaired its performance acoustics to world standards, and installed state-of-the-art stage technology and back-of-house facilities. It is an outstanding heritage response to an important civic and heritage place of architectural, social and cultural significance. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: ARM's underlying task was to repair Hamer Hall's standing as a major civic building and make it a 21st-century venue. The building represents two artistic discourses in Melbourne: the architectural story of the castle and the mine: the theatrical story of the palace and the cave of jewels. ARM reinterpreted these narratives and added their voice to the story of Hamer Hall.

Visually, the school creates a civic narrative through the school's city skyline' silhouette façade, which alludes to the city of learning within. It also connects with its community through colour and pattern inspired by the traditional dress of local ethnic groups. This work attests to MCR's ongoing practice of creating civic narratives as a way to provide connections with the greater community and context.

RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION The as-found condition of the space of the old department store was strong and stripped back, with four-metre high concrete ceilings, a very deep plan, and a series of large civic-scale windows overlooking Swanston and Bourke Streets. The new plan establishes an even field of workstations for the required eighty people. The aim was to clarify something about the nature of the space, and to touch as little as possible of its existing condition. Everyone is seated to be aligned with one of the large windows, which means they are also aligned with the structural bay and exposed beams above.

RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION The landscape architectural design for the Churchill Intergenerational Community Hub project explored the generative potential of computational patterning to create a choreography of place. To achieve this, site geography and architectural data was sourced to generate a voronoi pattern (a mathematical pattern that uses convex polygons). This pattern forms an underlying template or thumbprint for the site. This pattern was further iterated through design development to configure the spatial organisation of the overall project as well as to drive the positioning of form and the play of materiality across the five playgrounds of the Hub.

These theoretical narratives are placed in dialogue with a reflection on a design research pedagogical project. The theoretical narratives and design research project seek to articulate the multidimensionality of critical education. The methodology enacted in the paper performs the pedagogy of the classroom.</P></P><P>Findings<P>The study yields compelling con"

         "BACKGROUND Approximately 65% of Ho Chi Minh's population live in the Hems (alleyways). The hem is a unique attribute of Vietnamese urban life and offers a glimpse of life beyond the business and tourist dominated centre. The broader research field of enquiry of this project aims to develop Hay's (1997) assertion that film [moving image] is a social practice and through that informs architectural problem solving as much as architecture informs moving image problem solving. This research draws on this notion to explore how moving image can capture, archives can store and creative practices can be developed from the detailed results of this 'social practice'. It investigates the visual boundaries of a given space, that are polarised by tempo, and the intrinsic nature of the streets of Ho Chi Minh, in order to map the physical and social boundaries that define the Hems. It was developed through the research question 'How can moving image help define the visual and physical and temporal ext"

         "Analyzing Public Access and Boundary Utilization in Landscape Architecture",
         "(Background and Purpose) In contemporary society, Landscape Architecture crucially addresses the relationships between architecture and landscape, as well as individual and public realms within cities, establishing boundaries as areas with potential for communication while maintaining continuity between buildings and land. Despite the existence of developments ranging from single buildings to large-scale urban projects, many boundary and green spaces are currently applied in cities in isolated and passive ways, with limited functionality in terms of accessibility and publicness. Furthermore, the potential of Landscape Architecture to function diversely within urban environments is underutilized due to a lack of research on its boundary components and methods, compounded by uniform regulations. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes using the boundary spaces of buildings as a solution to practical urban problems, examining the construction methods and components of Landscape Archite"

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Logan Hall is a 7-level building by McBride Charles Ryan (MCR) that delivers 250 student accommodation units for Monash University. It incorporates both living and communal areas designed to increase communication and exchanges with other tenants. The building occupies an important corner in the design of the Clayton campus, and has contributed to a new sense of urban legibility for the broader University. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: To the north and east, Logan Hall has a generous colonnade which aligns with the natural pedestrian desire lines of the campus. The colonnade provides a sheltered space between the cafes and the northern landscaped forecourt. To the east, the split masses of the building reinforce the civic quality of Scenic Boulevard. To the north, the modularity of the student units has been utilized to provide an unlikely and expressive form the recalls the distinct modernist origins of the Monash Clayton Campus.

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: 5th Studio - Holbrook's architectural practice - developed Calvert for the Wolfson Economics Prize 2014, responding to the call to deliver a visionary, economically viable, and popular Garden City. The propositional project offers a series of civic environments that fuel debate regarding the value of spatial planning and use of public land. Calvert was exhibited at Occupied, Design Hub, 2016. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Calvert offers alternatives to market driven, contemporary development that often lacks engagement with the risk and spatial complexities that make good cities. In response to the 'garden city' concept, the imagined 'city in a garden' creates conditions for mediation between individual citizens and the collective. Calvert proposes that huge investments of money, land and political energy might be used in multiple ways to create delight. This project draws on Holbrook's ongoing design research in developing strategic thinking that explores dynamics betwee"

         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P><P>A 12 month study of urban concentrations of total suspended particulates (TSP) and 20 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was carried out in Seoul (South Korea), Hong Kong, Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia) and Melbourne (Australia). Concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere varied widely between the cities over the course of the study, ranging from a low of 24.1&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Melbourne during the winter to a high of 376.2&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Jakarta during the dry season. Seasonal variations in both TSP and PAH were observed in the tropical cities in the study with higher concentrations during the dry season and lower concentrations during the wet season. TSP and PAH concentrations are correlated with each other in these cities, suggesting that they have related sources and sinks for these cities. In the temperate cities of Melbourne and Seoul, PAH concentrations were higher during the cold winter season an"

CONTRIBUTION Kosloff's research centres on how movement, gesture and abstraction translate into significance. Like Mike Parr's rolling camera, Kosloff also films as if the camera were a moving figure (John Hurrell Eye Contact Mar 2010). For her site-specific video installations with Super 8 as a medium for all 3 works Kosloff exploits its capacity for articulating a particular pace and movement in monochrome removing the specificity of time and place (You wonder if these people are still alive now, but of course probably they are, very much so Hurrell.

         "This paper begins by situating the large screen in Melbourne as part of the industrial cluster development of the Southbank cultural precinct. It examines urban regeneration and cultural policies to map the politics of its spatial geography of agglomeration. It further explores the role of networked screen in the formation of a transnational creative cluster. Using a telematic large screen event staged across Melbourne and Seoul, the paper evaluates the responses of audiences to examine the politics of cultural and civic engagement. While scholarships on creative clusters predominantly focus on the new value chain of industrial and commercial production that arises as a result of agglomeration, this paper argues that the large screen possesses the capacity not only to invigorate public participation, but as a transnational creative cluster, the networked large screen also possesses the potential to enhance the quality of intercultural communication between Asia and Australia."

Higher urbanization rates in cities may result in high temperature warming, which is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Recently, researchers have revealed pronounced effects based on HW and UHI interactions; however, studies that linked their effects with surface energy fluxes in different urban landscape and climate are still inadequate. This study utilized the Community Land Model (CLM) to assess the effect of HW towards UHI, while considering energy fluxes variations in Seoul, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and Melbourne, with different climate influences and urban morphologies. Generally, Seoul and Tokyo showed intense HW magnitude from 2000 to 2018 based on the HW indices. The surface energy flux components demonstrated a distinct pattern especially from 11"

The Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework was developed in Canada by Graham and colleagues in the 2000s, following a review of 31 planned action theories. The framework has two components: Knowledge Creation and an Action Cycle, each of which comprises multiple phases. This review sought to answer two questions: ‘Is the KTA Framework used in practice? And if so, how?’</P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P>This study is a citation analysis and systematic review. The index citation for the original paper was identified on three databases&#x2014;Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar&#x2014;with the facility for citation searching. Limitations of English language and year of publication 2006-June 2013 were set. A taxonomy categorising the continuum of usage was developed. Only studies applying the framework to implementation projects were included. Data were extracted and "

Analysis of the site's defensive architecture provides unique information about the city's internal design. Dry moats, walled roads, and steep terrace facades subdivide the community into a series of population segments that on the basis of both size and architecture type resemble ward divisions found in central Mexico cities at the time of Conquest. Furthermore, Xochicalco does not have a single defensive perimeter characteristic of a strongly centralized polity; instead, it possesses a series of defensive precincts located on the hills and ridges adjacent to Cerro Xochicalco that are equivalent in form and redundant in function.

We examine decommunization through the lens of an extensive legacy of architectural, urban design, and monumental art projects erected for the celebration of the 1500th anniversary of the city of Kyiv held in 1982. We focus on four ideological narratives and examine the outcomes of decommunization on four monuments. We find that decommunization&rsquo;s effect is limited; Communist symbolism has been annotated with Ukrainian identity symbols or neglected, not demolished. We conclude that decommunization has focused on the comparatively superficial qualities of toponomy and Lenin symbols, that the legacy of Soviet identity in Kyiv&rsquo;s cityscape is much deeper and has proved surprisingly persistent, and that the historiography of the newly independent nation of Ukraine is still in a "

The article examines the processes of urban reconstruction and architectural reconfigurations in the city as “frontier urbanism”, building on Wendy Pullan’s (2011) discussion of how various actors employ architectural and place-making practices to secure the state in contested urban space. The article traces Rijeka/Fiume´s urban development as a window of fixating state identities in the built environment throughout the century, focusing on the aftermath of the Second World War. It examines the urban transformations of the city as the demographic landscape was reshaped after the departure of the local Italian-speaking majority and the arrival of workers from various parts of Yugoslavia, but "

Here, we describe the implementation of our BCI speech synthesis system, which can be trained with a limited amount of overt speech to produce a continuous stream of audio outputs during subsequent speech imagery tasks. We evaluate (1) the effect of parameter choices on the execution time of individual operations in the BCI loop and (2) the accuracy of predicted outputs. To confirm the feasibility of our approach, we conduct simulations in a pseudo-prospective fashion using recorded datasets from five patients undergoing intracranial epilepsy monitoring. We propose that our system can be used to synthesize different types of speech under specific clinical constraints.</P>"

Kerstin Thompson Architecture (KTA) showed five works - Carrum Downs Police Station, MUMA Gallery, Lake Conneware House, Napier Street Housing and Royal Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre - as one of ten architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected to exhibit. The exhibited work included large scale photographs, working drawings and exegetical text. CONTRIBUTION: The exhibition explored architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. Within this context, the public projects exhibited by KTA explore relationships between interior and exterior, building and street, and the existing and the new. This draws on Thompson's ongoing practice a"

These projects were selected for exhibition in the reciprocal international Seoul/Melbourne exhibition, 'Architectural Urbanism'. Baracco + Wright was one of ten young architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected for inclusion in the event. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Exhibition curator Melanie Dodd said 'Architectural Urbanism' would explore architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. The 4 selected works by B+W exemplify this approach, by sharing common ground which transcends their formal differences because of how they play with the threshold and boundaries of urban site conditions as a mean"

Since sustainability is linked to public values, research on sustainable public spaces is an important way to secure sustainability in cities. Based on this, we analyzed the sustainability of European cities by examining the design methods of public architecture according to the region. The aim of the study is to derive architectural methodology corresponding to local characteristics, and to suggest issues to consider in public architecture design to promote urban sustainability based on this. First, regarding the environmental aspect, it can be observed that there is an effort to secure sustainability. Second, in terms of social sustainability, historical value remains as a trace of architectural place, so that it continues in people&rsquo;s memory. In addition, public architecture provides public places where citizens can gather and"

The square is part of the $290 million Revitalising Central Dandenong project. It opened in March 2014. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: 'Alterations', the ground pattern for the new Civic Square is a translation of topographical, clothing and locally-sourced patterns into a design that reconfigures the local ground as a giant body in motion or choreography. The name refers to the work of local tailors. The project develops and extends Paul Carter's research on how to historicise public space. Beginning with Federation Square (2002) Carter has worked on several projects in which inscriptions reveal the poetic, cultural and material aspects of sites.

It was decided that the design should be at once simple and raw, that it would exploit the potential of the existing building and leave nothing to waste. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION The as-found condition of the space of the old department store was strong and stripped back, with four-metre high concrete ceilings, a very deep plan, and a series of large civic-scale windows overlooking Swanston and Bourke Streets. The new plan establishes an even field of workstations for the required eighty people. The aim was to clarify something about the nature of the space, and to touch as little as possible of its existing condition. Everyone is seated to be aligned with one of the large windows, which means they are also aligned with the structural bay and exposed beams above. This simple meter means that desks are a bit further apa"

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Mobile Landscapes (III) was developed as a new key project for the curatorial theme 'Ephemeral Architectures' for the X-Field Archive (as part of the exhibition Neighbouring Effect, Seoul, Korea, and for subsequent iterations). Mobile Landscapes is a mapping of the Murray River, building upon several years of archival research of its flood histories. It comprises: a line drawing of the 2500-kilometre river system (15 A4 sheets of drafting film), and 15 photographic recordings (each A6 format) of a 24 kilometre walk undertaken (in 2001) across the '1956 floodplain'. The line drawing shows the existing river, the shoreline of a 1:100 year flood event (1956) and the survey grids of existing river towns. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The major contribution is within the scholarship of site studies in architecture, and has particular relevance as an approach to uncovering invisible site histories. This knowledge is useful in the design process as it can help the architect enga"

         "BACKGROUND: The K2K design proposal, developed by JMD Design (the practice of Anton James) in collaboration with Hill Thallis, and Bennet and Trimble, won the K2K Urban Design Competition in 2016. The competition was run by Randwick City Council, which invited the world's best architects, planners and urbanists to imagine a sustainable and innovative vision for the future of Kensington and Kingsford Town Centres. CONTRIBUTION: The K2K corridor sits within an ancient landscape and water system that ran from Centennial Park to Botany Bay. The Millstream, the most enduring trace of this system, runs parallel to Doncaster Avenue. Over the past century it has been capped and canalised, its primacy in the landscape superseded by the grand axis of Anzac Parade. The proposal that JMD collaborated on invests in the ancient system and reveals it as a complementary figure to Anzac Parade. Combining enhanced public open space and water management, together these initiatives define a new and highly"

         "<jats:p>The city of Rijeka/Fiume underwent an array of transitions in the long twentieth century, from the port of Hungary in the Dual Monarchy to a free city, to D´Annunzio´s Italian Regency of Carnaro, annexation by Italy, incorporation into Yugoslavia, and eventually the independence of Croatia. The article examines the processes of urban reconstruction and architectural reconfigurations in the city as “frontier urbanism”, building on Wendy Pullan’s (2011) discussion of how various actors employ architectural and place-making practices to secure the state in contested urban space. The article traces Rijeka/Fiume´s urban development as a window of fixating state identities in the built environment throughout the century, focusing on the aftermath of the Second World War. It examines the urban transformations of the city as the demographic landscape was reshaped after the departure of the local Italian-speaking majority and the arrival of workers from various parts of Yugoslavia, but "

         "RESEARCH BACKGROUND: The 'Urban Still Life (with mops and brooms): Beijing version' installation depicted an informal occupation of the public realm that lies outside of ownership and traditional property lines, and blurs the edges between public and private, civic and domestic. The project was conceived to be cumulative and comparative as it travelled to three Asian cities; local images were added in Beijing to those collected in previous exhibitions in Seoul and Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: This work builds upon research in bottom-up or micro-urbanism strategies in the Asian city. It develops observational and participatory techniques to enable the general public to engage with urban design issues by contributing to the exhibition with text and images. This work marks a significant shift within Asia. Instead of looking to the West for solutions to contemporary urban design issues, this research proposes that Asia is now providing more appropriate models to deal with the complexi"

The theme is: Here we are, accepting that we share the world. Another form of IE that deserves to attract more interest is multireligious collaboration in civic work (addressing homelessness, urban blight, illiteracy, etc.). Some adherents of the intrinsically cosmopolitan &ldquo;world&rdquo; religions are actively cosmopolitan to the extent of seeking this engagement.

         "<P> This study investigates the spatial effects of the ongoing &ldquo;decommunization&rdquo; campaign in Ukraine, a state-led attack on Soviet symbols and ideology in the urban space of the capital, Kyiv. We examine decommunization through the lens of an extensive legacy of architectural, urban design, and monumental art projects erected for the celebration of the 1500th anniversary of the city of Kyiv held in 1982. We focus on four ideological narratives and examine the outcomes of decommunization on four monuments. We find that decommunization&rsquo;s effect is limited; Communist symbolism has been annotated with Ukrainian identity symbols or neglected, not demolished. We conclude that decommunization has focused on the comparatively superficial qualities of toponomy and Lenin symbols, that the legacy of Soviet identity in Kyiv&rsquo;s cityscape is much deeper and has proved surprisingly persistent, and that the historiography of the newly independent nation of Ukraine is still in a "

         "This paper begins by situating the large screen in Melbourne as part of the industrial cluster development of the Southbank cultural precinct. It examines urban regeneration and cultural policies to map the politics of its spatial geography of agglomeration. It further explores the role of networked screen in the formation of a transnational creative cluster. Using a telematic large screen event staged across Melbourne and Seoul, the paper evaluates the responses of audiences to examine the politics of cultural and civic engagement. While scholarships on creative clusters predominantly focus on the new value chain of industrial and commercial production that arises as a result of agglomeration, this paper argues that the large screen possesses the capacity not only to invigorate public participation, but as a transnational creative cluster, the networked large screen also possesses the potential to enhance the quality of intercultural communication between Asia and Australia."

         "(Background and Purpose) In contemporary society, Landscape Architecture crucially addresses the relationships between architecture and landscape, as well as individual and public realms within cities, establishing boundaries as areas with potential for communication while maintaining continuity between buildings and land. Despite the existence of developments ranging from single buildings to large-scale urban projects, many boundary and green spaces are currently applied in cities in isolated and passive ways, with limited functionality in terms of accessibility and publicness. Furthermore, the potential of Landscape Architecture to function diversely within urban environments is underutilized due to a lack of research on its boundary components and methods, compounded by uniform regulations. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes using the boundary spaces of buildings as a solution to practical urban problems, examining the construction methods and components of Landscape Archite"

         "본 논문은 랜드스케이프 어바니즘의 실천적 주제를 통해 점차 도시화되어가는 건축의 실험적 영역의 가능성을 타진해 본다. 대표적인 랜드스케이프 건축가인 제임스 코너의 랜드스케이프 어바니즘의 실천적 주제와 크리스트퍼 지롯과 세바츠찬 바롯의 랜드스케이프 건축의 개념간의 매스릭스 분석을 통해 시간기반프로세스, 표면의 잠재적 영역성, 실천적 방법론 상상력의 주제들이 이미 어바니즘을 넘어 건축의 영역으로 충분히 들어와 있음을 확인할 수 있었다. 이는 랜드스케이프 어바니즘 전반적 랜드스케이프 개념의 트레이싱 그리고 건축적 랜드스케이프 개념간의 상호 관계를 드러내는 매트릭스 밀도를 통해 보다 세부적인 주제별 특성들과 전략들을 가늠해 볼 수 있도록 한다. 결과적으로 건축공간내 다양한 사건공간을 만들어 내는 현대건축의 주요한 공간특성을 구성하는 랜드스케이프의 전략은 외부공간으로 확대되어 랜드스케이프 어바니즘으로 연속되어 건축도시공간은 거대한 사건의 장소로 강화된다."

         "The Rotary Club of Dingley in partnership with the Springvale Sub Branch of the RSL invited submissions for a public art commission as memorial to ex-service men and women who lost their lives in defense of Australia. The work would be sited within the Dingley Village community and would become a central point for community commemorative services and other community cultural and educational programs.The design proposal developed by SueAnne Ware incorporates sweeping pathway, mass planting of red poppies with a 'Floating Plane' memorial structure set into to the plantings. The site proposed is adjacent to the Dingley Library and Dingley Village Community Centre, amongst established Ghost Gum trees. The proposed memorial would become spectacularly activated by the blooming of the poppies en masse as symbol of remembrance of lives lost in combat. The research contribution of this work is embedded in the situated nature of local war memorials, the use of conventional memorial architecture "
