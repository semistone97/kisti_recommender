However, many clinical problems occur in knee joints of Korean patients after total knee joint replacement owing to the geometric mismatch between the western implants and Korean knee joint structures. To solve these problems, a method to determine the representative dimension parameter values of Korean knee joints is introduced to aid in the design of knee joint implants appropriate for Korean patients. Measurements of the dimension parameters of 88 male Korean knee joint subjects were carried out. The distribution of the subjects versus each measured parameter value was investigated. The measured dimension parameter values of each parameter were grouped by suitable intervals called the &ldquo;size group,&rdquo; and average values of the size groups were calculated. The knee joint subjects were grouped as the &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; based on &ldquo;size group numbers&rd"

Three fresh cadaver knees were imaged at 6 flexion angles between 0&#x00B0; and 120&#x00B0; by MRI, a combination of RSA and CT and 3D digitisation (in two knees). Virtual models of all 42 positions were created using suitable computer software. Each virtual model was aligned to a newly defined anatomically based Cartesian coordinate system. The angular rotations around the 3 coordinate system axes were calculated directly from the aligned virtual models using rigid body kinematics and found to be equally accurate for the 3 methods. The 3 rotations in each knee could be depicted using anatomy-based diagrams for all 3 methods. We conclude that the 3 methods of data acquisition are equally and adequately accurate in vitro. MRI may be the most useful in vivo.</P>"

This method is a first step towards automation of prosthesis placement. Thanks to the mathematically computed four-bar mechanism, it is now possible to emulate the implant insertion before the operation. This model allows the surgeon to fit the prosthesis to the patient&#x2019;s knee and to verify if the mounted position is optimal. This process can be repeated until the ideal position is found. Exact copies of the bones are made from the CT images of the patient. These resin copies of the real bones are placed in the motion model, reproducing the real patient&#x2019;s knee flexion. The model shows the implantation result with respect to the operation plan and the patient&#x2019;s kinematics.

The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation).

Although many devices exist for joints kinematics assessment, there is a need for a system that could be used in routine practice. Such a system should be accurate, ambulatory, and easy to use. The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics (ISB). A simple method based on a leg movement is proposed here to align two inertial measurement units fixed on the thigh and shank segments.

Our model predicted tibiofemoral contact force with reasonable accuracy in both subjects. This model can be a very useful tool to predict the effect of surgical techniques and component alignment on contact forces.

In those cases where the full spatial motion is measured, the data are available to describe the motion in simpler terms (or with less DOF) than three rotations with three translations. This is necessary for clinical application and to facilitate communication between the clinician and the engineer. </P>"

         "<P>We report a study that developed algorithms to measure the dimension and uncertainty range of free space inside the knee joint for the purpose of minimally invasive surgery. During knee arthroscopy, the patient's leg position is continuously adjusted to create the space for surgical instruments inside the joint. Surgeons 'feel' the force they apply to the leg and estimate the joint space from a 2D video. In many cases, they overestimate the instrument gap, resulting in damaging to the knee joint by pushing instruments through a gap that is too small. We used cadaveric experiments to inform the noise induced by the sensors and image processing steps, to derive an error point-cloud in a simulated environment. From the point-cloud, we calculate the instrument gap range inside the knee joint. For a selected surgical instrument gap size, the measurement algorithm is accurate to less than a millimetre. However, measurement errors introduce an uncertainty of 14%. The performance of our alg"

         "It is necessary to have a model that describes the feature of the knee joint with a sufficient accuracy. Koreans, however, do not have their own knee joint model used in the total knee replacement arthroplasty. They have to use European and American models but they do not match to Korean's knee joint components. Past days many doctors actually measured the knee joint shape using calipers while operating patients or the size of 2D image-like as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image. Recently, three-dimensional visualization techniques are found to be useful in a wide range of medical applications. Three-dimensional imaging studies such as CT and MRI provide the primary source of patient-specific data. In this study, three dimensional knee joint models were constructed by image processing of CT data for 15 persons. Using the constructed model, the size of knee joint of Korean was measured. Finally this study proposed the method and standard of measurement by using 3D knee joint model. The proposed 3D model and data and method of measurement can be helpful to develop Korean knee implant and analysis of knee joint movement."

         "<P> Knee joint implants developed by western companies have been imported to Korea and used for Korean patients. However, many clinical problems occur in knee joints of Korean patients after total knee joint replacement owing to the geometric mismatch between the western implants and Korean knee joint structures. To solve these problems, a method to determine the representative dimension parameter values of Korean knee joints is introduced to aid in the design of knee joint implants appropriate for Korean patients. Measurements of the dimension parameters of 88 male Korean knee joint subjects were carried out. The distribution of the subjects versus each measured parameter value was investigated. The measured dimension parameter values of each parameter were grouped by suitable intervals called the &ldquo;size group,&rdquo; and average values of the size groups were calculated. The knee joint subjects were grouped as the &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; based on &ldquo;size group numbers&rdquo; of each parameter. From the iterative calculations to decrease the errors between the average dimension parameter values of each &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; and the dimension parameter values of the subjects, the average dimension parameter values that give less than the error criterion were determined to be the representative dimension parameter values for designing knee joint implants for Korean patients. </P>"

         "Anatomical and biomechanical assessment of the anterolateral ligament of the knee joint : a Korean cadaveric study using a triaxial accelerometer",
         "Introduction&amp;#xD; The anterolateral ligament (ALL) has recently been thought to play an important role in the rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). However, there are still some controversies in the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL. The purpose of this study was to investigate anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL using Korean cadaveric knee joints. We investigated the effect of ALL injury on its footprint distances under various knee conditions and assessed three-dimensional functional stability tests (pivot-shift and Lachmann tests) using a noninvasive triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Materials and Methods&amp;#xD; 20 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were dissected by a single surgeon. The locations of the tibial and femoral footprints of the ALL were recorded with respect to the lateral femoral epicondyle, tip of the fibular head, and Gerdy’s tubercle. The distance between the footprints were recorded in a normal knee condition. All cadavers were tested in neutral, internal, and external rotation at 30°, 60°, 90° of knee flexion. The pivot shift and Lachmann tests were measured using a triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA). Serial sectioning of the ALL and the ACL was performed after testing in normal knee joints. Measurements were collected before and after each sectioning.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Results&amp;#xD; Anatomical features of the current study were similar to those of previous cadaveric studies. The prevalence of the ALL in our study was 100%. Average distance of the tibial footprint to the tip of the fibular head was 19.85 ± 3.41 mm and to Gerdy’s tubercle was 18.3 ± 4.19mm. Average distance of the femoral footprint to the lateral femoral epicondyle was 10.25 ± 2.97mm. The footprint distance of the ALL was the longest at 30° of knee flexion (47.83 ± 8.05 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001) in a normal knee neutral rotation condition. An internal rotational force produced statistically significant increases in footprint distances in normal knees at all three knee flexion angles. During internal rotation, the footprint distance was also the longest at 30° of knee flexion (50.05 ± 8.88 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although an internal rotational force did not produce a statistically significant increase in the footprint distance after ALL transection, it increased the footprint distance at all three knee flexion angles after a combined ACL and ALL transection (p = 0.022). After a combined ACL and ALL transection, the footprint distance was the longest at 30° of knee flexion under internal rotational force (52.05 ± 7.60 mm). Pivot shift and Lachmann tests measured by the KiRA device did not show statistically significant differences between normal and ALL-transected knees. However, there were significant differences in the combined ACL-ALL-transected knees compared with normal and ALL-transected knees (p&amp;lt;0.001).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Conclusion&amp;#xD; The ALL was identified as a distinct ligament structure in this Korean cadaveric study. Considering the footprint distances of the ALL in various knee conditions, the ALL is thought to play a protective role in internal rotational stability especially at 30° of knee flexion. Isolated ALL transection did not show significant effects on the ALL footprint distances and functional stability tests. The ALL is thought to act as a secondary supportive stabilizer for rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the ACL.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Keywords: knee joint, anterolateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament, rotatory instability, KiRA, anterolateral ligament reconstruction, Korean cadaver&amp;#xD;"

         "Ambulatory measurement of 3D knee joint angle",
         "Three-dimensional measurement of joint motion is a promising tool for clinical evaluation and therapeutic treatment comparisons. Although many devices exist for joints kinematics assessment, there is a need for a system that could be used in routine practice. Such a system should be accurate, ambulatory, and easy to use. The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics (ISB). A simple method based on a leg movement is proposed here to align two inertial measurement units fixed on the thigh and shank segments. Based on the combination of the former alignment and a fusion algorithm, the three-dimensional knee joint angle is measured and compared with a magnetic motion capture system during walking. The proposed system is suitable to measure the absolute knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction angles with mean (SD) offset errors of -1<SUP>o</SUP> (1<SUP>o</SUP>) and 0<SUP>o</SUP> (0.6<SUP>o</SUP>) and mean (SD) root mean square (RMS) errors of 1.5<SUP>o</SUP> (0.4<SUP>o</SUP>) and 1.7<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The system is also suitable for the relative measurement of knee internal/external rotation (mean (SD) offset error of 3.4<SUP>o</SUP> (2.7<SUP>o</SUP>)) with a mean (SD) RMS error of 1.6<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The method described in this paper can be easily adapted in order to measure other joint angular displacements such as elbow or ankle."

Standard 3D reconstructions of one fresh frozen cadaveric knee specimen with implanted stereotactic reference markers were created. These reconstructions were based on the data from CT and MR scans performed before and after the resection of extraosseous soft tissues. The distances between the stereotactic reference markers in the 3D reconstructions were compared with the same measurements of the specimen using a Bridgeport milling machine as a precision 3D digitizer. The accuracy of intermarker distance measurements averaged 99% for CT-based reconstructions compared with 97.5% for MR-based reconstructions. Planar slices at a predetermined level and orientation through the femoral condyles were created by sequential milling of the specimen and were compared with reconstructed oblique planar CT and MR slices at the same level and orientation. The accuracy of condylar dimensional measurements was 94% for CT and 93% for MR compared with measurements of the milled slices. Three-dimensional reconstructions based on CT and MR scan data were of equally high quality and were unaffected by the status of the soft tissues.</P>"

The independent <I>t</I>-test and paired <I>t</I>-test were used for statistical analysis. </P><P><B>Results</B></P><P> The proximal tibia had concave and convex surfaces in the medial and lateral plateaus, respectively, for both genders.

Gender-based difference was not found in the medial diameter of the tibial plateau but was observed in the lateral diameter. </P><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P> These results may provide guidelines for a suitable knee implant design for the Korean patients. The incorporation of this shape information in the medial and lateral sides in the prosthetics for a total knee arthroplasty and a lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty can improve knee range motion.</P>"

         "목적: 자기공명영상을 이용하여 한국인 슬관절 부위에 위치한 신경-혈관 다발의 해부학적 위치를 연구하여 슬관절의 관절경 수술 시에 발생하는 신경-혈관 다발 손상의 발생을 예방하고자 하였다. 대상 및 방법: 100례의 한국인 슬관절에 대한 자기공명영상 축스캔에 횡축과 중앙축을 그려서 신경-혈관 다발과 중앙축의 거리를 측정하였고, 성별과 좌, 우측을 구분하여 분석하였다. 통계학적인 검증은 SPSS(ver. 10.1)을 이용하였고, 성별의 차이는 t-test를, 좌, 우측 위치에 따른 차이는 paired t-test를 이용하여 유의 수준 0.05에서 판정하였다. 결과: 한국인 슬관절의 신경-혈관 다발은 94례에서 중앙축의 외측에 위치하였고, 중앙축에 6례 위치하였고, 중앙축의 내측에는 한례도 관찰되지 않았다. 성별과 좌-우측 에 대한 비교 연구에도 통계학적으로 특별한 차이가 없었다(P>0.05). 결론: 관절경을 이용한 후방십자인대 재건술이나 연골판의 후각부 수술 시에 자기공명영상으로 신경-혈관 다발의 위치를 미리 파악하여, 중심축에 있다면 신경-혈관 다발의 손상에 대해서 주의가 요하리라 사료된다."

         "A data process of human knee joint kinematics obtained by motion-capture measurement",
         "<P><B>Background</B></P><P>The motion capture has been used as the usual method for measuring movement parameters of human, and most of the measuring data are obtained by partial manual process based on commercial software. An automatic kinematics data process was developed by programming on MATLAB software in this paper.</P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P>The motion capture measurement of healthy volunteers was carried out and the MATLAB program was used for data process. Firstly, the coordinate data of markers and anatomical points on human lower limb measured by motion capture system were read and repaired through the usual and the patch program. Meantime, the local coordinate systems of human femur and tibia were established with anatomical points. Then flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and internal/external rotation of human knee tibiofemoral joint were obtained by special coordinate transformation program.</P><P><B>Results</B></P><P>Using the above methods, motion capture measurements and batch data processing were carried out on squatting and climbing stairs of 29 healthy volunteers. And the motion characteristics (flexion/extension, internal/external rotation and adduction/abduction) of the knee joint were obtained. For example, the maximum internal/external rotation in squatting and climbing stairs were respectively was 30.5 degrees and 14 degrees, etc. Meantime, the results of this paper also were respectively compared with the results processed by other research methods, and the results were basically consistent, thus the reliability of our research method was verified. After calibration processing, the compiled MATLAB program of this paper can directly be used for efficient batch processing and avoiding manual modeling one by one.</P><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P>A novel Patch Program of this paper has been developed, which can make reasonable compensation for missing and noise signals to obtain more complete motion data. At the same time, a universal data processing program has also been developed for obtaining the relative movement of various components of the human body, and the program can be modified for detail special analysis. These motion capture technologies can be used to judge whether the human body functions are abnormal, provide a reference for rehabilitation treatment and design of rehabilitation equipment, and evaluate the effectiveness before and after surgery.</P>"

         "Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is permanent and reliable solution for arthritis and debilitating pain in the knee joint. It is a surgery in which the infected knee is replaced with biocompatible components of Total Knee Replacement. Total Knee Replacement has three components- femoral component, bearing component, and tibial component. These components are fixed to Femur and Tibia bones with a strong cement (Kanyal, 2021). The point cloud data of a posterior-stabilized, fixed bearing total knee prosthesis, PFC Sigma (De Puy, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leeds, UK) is presented here. The data consists of point cloud data of femoral component, bearing component, and tibial component. The point cloud data of each component can be imported into a reverse engineering software like Geomagic Studio (Raindrop Geomagic, Research Triangle Park, NC) where it can be converted into a CAD model. After obtaining CAD models of all three components- femoral component, bearing component, and tibial component, they can be assembled in a CAD software like Solidworks or Catia like Kanyal(2021) did. The final CAD assembly can be used to perform a finite element analysis concerning Total Knee Replacement which can be very useful to visualize kinematics and mechanics of the Total Knee Replacement."

         "# Knee Model Data Validation for Specimen 192803 - Experimental Data,  Models, Code, and Results This dataset contains experimental data, models,  code, and results for the S192803 specimen data. This dataset is one of  two model datasets used in the paper Validation of Subject-Specific Knee  Models from In Vivo Measurements, which is in review at the Journal of  Biomechanical Engineering. The dataset contained herein is derived from  the experimental data collected during a previous publication in the  Journal of Medical Devices, entitled: \\Apparatus for In Vivo Knee  Laxity Assessment Using High-Speed Stereo Radiography\\. Available at:  [https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4051834](https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4051834Another) A similar dataset exists for the other specimen, S193761. Work was created by Dr. Thor E. Andreassen, Dr. Donald R. Hume, Dr. Landon D. Hamilton, Stormy L. Hegg, Sean E. Higinbotham, and Dr. Kevin B. Shelburne at the Center for Orthopaedic Biomechanics at the University of Denver.

B. \\Validation of Subject-Specific Knee Models from In Vivo Measurements.\\ ASME. *J. Biomech, Engineering*. ## Code The code provided is contained in the \\Working Models\\ and the \\Processing Code\\ Folders. The optimization of the model can be run by running the \\Lig_Calibration.m\\ file in the \\Optimization Full\\ folder. The code will run the Abaqus trials specified by the \\JOBNAMES\\ and \\JOBLIST\\ files. Values for the ligament parameters will be updated in the \\Lig-Parameters.inp\\ file according to the current trial for the optimization. Kinematics will be extracted using the .py files and then the errors of these will be compared against the known laxity kinematics in the \\Data_Processed_2.mat\\ file. The global cost will be calculated according to the weights in the \\Weight.xlsx\\ file. Then the new set of design variables will be calculated and used to update the \\Lig-Parameters.inp\\ file. The optimization will continue until manually stopped o convergence within a tolerance is reached. To view experimental results of a given trial following optimization, the chosen parameters are update in the \\AMP_TEST.inp\\ file for the knee flexion angle, and the desired loads. These are updated by changing the parameters of the \\TF_KIN_STEP2_CYLINDRICAL_FE\\ and the \\TF_LOAD_STEP2_\\ variables. Then the model can be run using the terminal on the \\MAIN_TEST.inp\\ file. Lastly, results can be extracted using the \\GET_ODB_Step_Info.m\\ script in the \\Processing Code\\ folder and choosing the correct ODB file, and whether the portion you are interested in is the \\LAXITY\\ step or the \\FLEXION\\ step. ## Description of the data and file structure This dataset represents original data from the work to validate the reproducibility of knee models based on the datasets used to build them. The files contained include Imaging Data, Knee Laxity Data, Optimization Code and Models, Processing Code, and Results. The imaging data provided include imaging and segmentation for the CT and MRI scans. Additional surface scans with color texture are provided as surface obj. The models were created in Abaqus Explicit and are provided as .inp files. All optimization and results are extracted using a combination of MATLAB and Python scripts. The .mhd files, together with the .raw files, are segmentation files that can be used in segmentation software such as 3D Slicer, Materialize Mimics, or Simpleware ScanIP. The .stl files and the .obj (.obj and .mtl and .png together) are 3D geometries representing the outer meshed as triangulated surfaces. The .stl files only contain the geometry, while the .obj files include the original color of the vertices in the .mtl and the .png files. Stl and obj files can be opened and manipulated in software such as MeshMixer, MeshLab, or HyperWorks Hypermesh. **Imaging Data - Original Cadaveric Specimen Images used for the creation of 3D geometries via segmentation** 1.

         "Two separate themes are presented in this paper. Aims: The first theme is to present a graphical modeling approach of human anatomical structures namely, the femur and the tibia. The second theme involves making a finite element analysis of stresses, displacements and deformations in prosthetic implants (the femoral implant and the polyethylene insert). Objectives: The graphical modeling approach comes in two parts. The first is the segmentation of MRI scanned images, retrieved in DICOM format for edge detection. In the second part, 3D-CAD models are generated from the results of the segmentation stage. The finite element analysis is done by first extracting the prosthetic implants from the reconstructed 3D-CAD model, then do a finite element analysis of these implants under objectively determined conditions such as; forces, allowed displacements, the materials composing implant, and the coefficient of friction. Conclusion: The objective of this work is to implement an interface for exchanging data between 2D MRI images obtained from a medical diagnosis of a patient and the 3D-CAD model used in various applications, such as; the extraction of the implants, stress analysis at the knee joint and can serve as an aid to surgery, also predict the behavior of the prosthetic implants vis-a-vis the forces acting on the knee joints."

         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P><P>There is a growing demand for information and computational technology for surgeons help with surgical planning as well as prosthetics design. The two-dimensional images are registered to the three-dimensional (3D) model for high efficiency. To reconstruct the 3D model of knee joint including bone structure and main soft tissue structure, the evaluation and analysis of sports injury and rehabilitation treatment are detailed in this study. Mimics 10.0 was used to reconstruct the bone structure, ligament, and meniscus according to the pulse diffusion-weighted imaging sequence (PDWI) and stir sequences of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Excluding congenital malformations and diseases of the skeletal muscle system, MRI scanning was performed on bilateral knee joints. Proton weighted sequence (PDWI sequence) and stir pulse sequence were selected for MRI. The models were imported into Geomagic Studio 11 software for refinement and modification, and 3D registration of bone structure and main soft tissue structure was performed to construct a digital model of knee joint bone structure and accessory cartilage and ligament structure. The 3D knee joint model including bone, meniscus, and collateral ligament was established. Reconstruction and image registration based on mimics and Geomagic Studio can build a 3D model of knee joint with satisfactory morphology, which can meet the requirements of teaching, motion simulation, and biomechanical analysis.</P>"

         "Fat pad syndrome is a knee joint condition/disease where acute or chronic inflammation occurs in the fat pad of the knee joint, and it is a cause of anterior knee pain. Fat pad syndrome usually occurs concurrently with other conditions/diseases to collectively cause anterior knee pain. No study to date has reported the treatment of anterior knee pain solely due to fat pad syndrome. Here, we report a case of fat pad syndrome of the knee joint as the sole cause of anterior knee pain in a 49-year-old woman who received integrated Korean medicine treatments (pharmacopuncture, acupuncture, herbal medicine, deep fascial meridian therapy, and chuna). Using patient-reported pain scale scores, the level of the patient's pain was relieved, and her mobility improved. Integrated Korean medicine treatments could be effective for patients who have fat pad syndrome of the knee joint."

         "<P>The statistical shape model (SSM) method that uses 2D images of the knee joint to predict the three-dimensional (3D) joint surface model has been reported in the literature. In this study, we constructed a SSM database using 152 human computed tomography (CT) knee joint models, including the femur, tibia and patella and analysed the characteristics of each principal component of the SSM. The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation). The computational time for each bone of the knee joint was within 30?s using a personal computer. The analysis of this study indicated that the SSM method could be a useful tool to construct 3D surface models of the knee with sub-millimeter accuracy in real time. Thus, it may have a broad application in computer-assisted knee surgeries that require 3D surface models of the knee.</P>"

         "<P>Purpose<P>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) based three-dimensional analysis of knee cartilage has evolved to become fully automatic. However, when implementing these measurements across multiple clinical centers, scanner variability becomes a critical consideration. Our purposes were to quantify and compare same-model variability (between repeated scans on the same MRI system) and cross-model variability (across different MRI systems) in knee cartilage thickness measurements using MRI scanners from five manufacturers, as analyzed with a specific 3D volume analysis software.</P></P><P>Methods<P>Ten healthy volunteers (eight males and two females, aged 22-60 years) underwent two scans of their right knee on 3T MRI systems from five manufacturers (Canon, Fujifilm, GE, Philips, and Siemens). The imaging protocol included fat-suppressed spoiled gradient echo and proton density weighted sequences. Cartilage regions were automatically segmented into 7 subregions using a specific deep learning-based 3D volume analysis software. This resulted in 350 measurements for same-model variability and 2,800 measurements for cross-model variability.</P></P><P>Results<P>For same-model variability, 82% of measurements showed variability &le;0.10 mm, and 98% showed variability &le;0.20 mm. For cross-model variability, 51% showed variability &le;0.10 mm, and 84% showed variability &le;0.20 mm. The mean same-model variability (0.06 ± 0.05 mm) was significantly lower than cross-model variability (0.11 ± 0.09 mm) (p < 0.001).</P></P><P>Conclusion<P>This study demonstrates that knee cartilage thickness measurements exhibit significantly higher variability across different MRI systems compared to repeated measurements on the same system, when analyzed using this specific software. This finding has important implications for multi-center studies and longitudinal assessments using different MRI systems and highlights the software-dependent nature of such variability assessments.</P></P>"

         "MR measurement and imaging of the knee joint in normal adults",
         "<P>Objective To provide normal reference value for traumatic disease of the knee by measuring menisci and ligaments of knee in normal adults. Methods MR examination was performed in the knee of 5a healthy volunteers respectively. The MR imaging parameter includes T1WI, T2WI and PDWI-I-T2WI sequence in sagittal, coronal position. The measuring date of meniscus, anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament and the lateral collateral ligament were obtained and compared with the results of the cadaver published in the related anatomic literature. The regression relationship between the body of meniscus, the width of tibial plateau and the weight of volunteer were analyzed statistically. Of the volunteers, 13 were performed with T2WI and PDWI fat saturation sequence scan, analyzed and compared the advantage of the two sequences in demonstrating the meniscus and ligament. Results The values of menisci measured in MRI were larger than the corresponding values in cadaver reported literature. The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus was thicker than the others. There was linear regression among the width of medial meniscus body, the width of the tibial plateau, and the body weight. The angle between ACI. and Blumensaat＇s line was less than 15° The PCI. angle was （120.89±5.63）°. Conclusion The measuring value of the knee by MRI reflects the information in vivo more accurately than the means of cadaver, it can provide the normal reference value for traumatic disease of the knee clinically. Linear regression equation may be constructed among the width of the medial meniscus body, the width of the tibial plateau and the body weight. MRI, especially T2WI and PDWI fat saturation sequence play an important role in demonstrating the structure of the knee joint.</P>"

         "<P>BACKGROUND: Gait analysis is important for the lower limb prosthesis design. Simulating the natural motion of the human knee in different terrains is useful for the design and performance assessment of the prosthetic knee. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to propose a four-bar knee joint measurement system which can simulate the natural knee motions to collect the kinetic parameters precisely and analyze the walking characteristics under different terrain conditions. METHODS: A low-cost four-bar knee joint mechanism was proposed and gait characteristics were assessed on level ground, ascending and descending stairs, and ascending and descending ramp. RESULTS: The initial knee flexion angle during stair ascent at heel strike is obviously larger than in other walking scenes. The stance phase accounts for 53% of a single gait cycle during stair descent, which is slightly lower than other walking scenarios. The period that both the hindfoot and forefoot contact the ground in ramp descent accounts for 18%, which is less than for the others. While the forefoot contacts the ground in ramp ascent, the maximum vertical ground reaction force of the forefoot occurs when the hindfoot and forefoot simultaneously contact the ground, whereas in other scenarios the forefoot contacts the ground solely. CONCLUSIONS: The four-bar knee joint can simulate the natural motion of the human knee accurately. The gait characteristics analysis of different walking scenarios indicated that the low-cost four-bar knee joint exoskeleton was suitable for human knee joint simulation.</P>"

         "<P><I>Objective.</I> To determine the reproducibility of frontal plane knee joint laxity measurement through the assessment of intra- and inter-rater reliability coefficients and intra- and inter-rater agreement coefficients.</P><P><I>Methods.</I> Two raters independently assessed the laxity of the knee joint in the frontal plane by three repeated measurements. Fourteen days later the assessment was repeated. Complete data were obtained from 20 healthy subjects. Laxity was assessed using a device which consisted of a chair with a free-moving arm that supported the subject&apos;s lower leg. Medial and lateral loads were applied, resulting in a varus and valgus movement in the knee joint. The intra- and inter-rater reliability coefficients [intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)] were estimated, as were the intra- and inter-rater agreement parameters [standard error of measurement (SEM) and minimal detectable difference (MDD)].</P><P><I>Results.</I> Adequate intra-rater reliability (ICC>0.80) was calculated for each rater&apos;s measurements of laxity. The inter-rater reliability was less adequate (ICC&equals;0.65) when calculated using the first day&apos;s measurements. However, inter-rater reliability was adequate (ICC&equals;0.88) when calculated using the day 14 measurements. The intra-rater measurement error calculated across occasions was 1.3&deg; for individual subjects. This resulted in an MDD of 3.7&deg;. The inter-rater measurement error, i.e. the SEM and MDD, was higher (1.5&deg; and 4.3&deg;, respectively).</P><P><I>Conclusions.</I> Intra-rater reliability of knee joint laxity measurement is good. Adequate training of raters establishes the basis for good inter-rater reliability. In clinical trials, it is preferable for one trained rater to perform the laxity measurement. The measurement of knee joint laxity is limited due to its relatively high measurement error in individual subjects; therefore, this measurement should be restricted to group assessment rather than individual patient assessment.</P>"

         "<P>Over the past few years, osteoarthritis is one of the most common knee diseases. The diagnosis and treatment of this disease is a vital importance. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown a good performance in learning the high-level features and in resolving segmentation issues. In this paper, we propose a new model of DL 3D-Res-UNet in order to accurately segment the knee cartilage from a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3D construction that allows perfectly visualizing the anatomical structure of this organ. This model is a combination of an architecture widely known in the literature for its segmentation efficiency (3D-UNet) with a residual architecture (3D-ResNet). The experimental results reveal that the suggested model can stabilize the training model, segment the cartilage from MRI very well and compete with the state of art on multiple performance metrics. The gain of precision and recall with 3DRes-UNet is given up to 15% and 26% compared to 3D-ResNet and 3D-UNet, respectively, hence the effectiveness of the suggested method.</P>"

         "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess the change of the articular cartilage thickness resulting from physiological aging in normal Korean people without any disease in knee joint. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Voluntary participants of 81 cases, physically normal and free from knee joint disease at present or in the past, were chosen for our research program. The subjects were divided into young, middle and old age group respectively for the male and female; and articular cartilage thickness using MRI were measured. RESULT: Each of the three groups reveals the tendency of decrease in the thickness of the knee joint cartilage in all of the age groups along with the increase of the age. The cartilage thickness according to age for both sex, except for the tibial medial condyle, decreased significantly. For the male subjects, the degree of decrease in cartilage thicknes indicates difference in each sections. However, in case of female, the change of articular cartilage thickness in overall sections showed more significantly decreased in young to middle age group than in middle to old age group. CONCLUSION: The results revealed the normal articular cartilage thickness of knee and time that the thickness of articular cartilage was decreased with age. And we could evaluate the severity of degenerative change of articular cartilage by comparison to normal articular cartilage thickness."

         "<P>It is believed by many that reference data for age estimation purposes must be imaging-modality specific. A study from our department has however proven otherwise. We therefore found it interesting to investigate this further by looking at the level of agreement between different imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the level of agreement between the three radiological modalities, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and digital radiography (DR), in assessing the ossification of the epiphyses of the knee. A total of 34 deceased individuals of 10&#x2013;25 years of age, brought in for a medicolegal autopsy at our department, were scanned by CT, MRI, and DR. The ossification stages of the three bones of the right knee, distal femoral, proximal tibial, and proximal fibular epiphysis were assessed using the established combined staging method by Schmeling et al. and Kellinghaus et al. Analysis of the results by Cohen&rsquo;s weighted kappa showed a good agreement between CT and DR (<I>K</I> = 0.61&#x2013;0.70), and MRI and DR (<I>K</I> = 0.68&#x2013;0.79) but only moderate agreement between CT and MRI (<I>K</I> = 0.55&#x2013;0.57). This leads us to conclude that different radiological images cannot be used interchangeably for age estimation purposes, so reference material needs to be imaging-modality specific. However, to make a more general conclusion research on a larger population is needed.</P>"

         "<P>This study was conducted on Korean male high school soccer players who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) to identify the effects of an accelerated rehabilitation exercise (ARE) program on knee joint isometric strength, thigh circumference, Lysholm score, and active balance agility. We assigned eight test participants each to a physical therapy group (PTG) and an accelerated rehabilitation exercise group (AREG), and compared differences between the groups. Both the PTG and AREG showed significant increases in 30° away and 60° toward isometric strength after treatment. In addition, significant differences were observed in these strength tests between the two groups. Both groups also showed significant increases in thigh circumference, Lysholm score, and active balance agility after treatment, but no significant differences were observed between the two groups. We conclude that the ARE treatment was more effective for improving isometric strength of the knee joint than that of physical therapy, and that an active rehabilitation exercise program after ACLR had positive effects on recovery performance of patients with an ACL injury and their return to the playing field.</P>"

         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The application of 3D printing patient specific instrumentation model in total knee arthroplasty was explored to improve the operative accuracy and safety of artificial total knee arthroplasty. In this study, a total of 52 patients who need knee replacement were selected as the study objects, and 52 patients were divided into experimental group and control group. First, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA), lateral femoral angle (LFA), hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), femorotibial angle (FTA) of research objects in both groups were measured. Then, the blood loss during the operations, drainage volume after operations, total blood loss, hidden blood loss, and hemoglobin decrease of the experiment group and the control group were measured and calculated. Finally, the postoperative outcomes of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty were evaluated. The results showed that before the operations, in the PSI group, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA) was (6.9 &plusmn; 2.4)&deg;, the lateral femoral angle (LFA) was (82.4 &plusmn; 1.6)&deg;, the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) was (166.4 &plusmn; 1.4)&deg;, and the femorotibial angle (FTA) was (179.5 &plusmn; 7.3)&deg;. In the CON group, the FMAA was (5.8 &plusmn; 2.4)&deg;, the LFA was (81.3 &plusmn; 2.1)&deg;, the HKA was (169.5 &plusmn; 1.9)&deg;, and the FTA was (185.4 &plusmn; 5.4)&deg;. The differences in these data between the two groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). After the operations, in the PSI group, the total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, and the hemoglobin (Hb) decrease were respectively (420.2 &plusmn; 210.5), (240.5 &plusmn; 234.5), and (1.7 &plusmn; 0.9); in the CON group, the total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, and the Hb decrease were respectively (782.1 &plusmn; 340.4), (450.9 &plusmn; 352.6), and (2.9 &plusmn; 1.0). These data of both groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Therefore, it can be seen that the 3D printing patient specific instrumentation model can effectively simulate the lower limb coronal force line and was highly consistent of the preoperative software simulation plan. In addition, the random interviews of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty showed that the knees of patients had recovered well. The application of 3D printing patient specific instrumentation model in artificial total knee arthroplasty can effectively improve the operative accuracy and safety, and the clinical therapeutic effects were significant.</P>"

Koreans, however, do not have their own knee joint model used in the total knee replacement arthroplasty. They have to use European and American models but they do not match to Korean's knee joint components. Past days many doctors actually measured the knee joint shape using calipers while operating patients or the size of 2D image-like as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image. Recently, three-dimensional visualization techniques are found to be useful in a wide range of medical applications. Three-dimensional imaging studies such as CT and MRI provide the primary source of patient-specific data. In this study, three dimensional knee joint models were constructed by image processing of CT data for 15 persons. Using the constructed model, the size of knee joint of Korean was measured. Finally this study proposed the method and standard of measurement by using 3D knee"

However, many clinical problems occur in knee joints of Korean patients after total knee joint replacement owing to the geometric mismatch between the western implants and Korean knee joint structures. To solve these problems, a method to determine the representative dimension parameter values of Korean knee joints is introduced to aid in the design of knee joint implants appropriate for Korean patients. Measurements of the dimension parameters of 88 male Korean knee joint subjects were carried out. The distribution of the subjects versus each measured parameter value was investigated. The measured dimension parameter values of each parameter were grouped by suitable intervals called the &ldquo;size group,&rdquo; and average values of the size groups were calculated. The knee joint subjects were grouped as the &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; based on &ldquo;size group numbers&rd"

This method is a first step towards automation of prosthesis placement. Thanks to the mathematically computed four-bar mechanism, it is now possible to emulate the implant insertion before the operation. This model allows the surgeon to fit the prosthesis to the patient&#x2019;s knee and to verify if the mounted position is optimal. This process can be repeated until the ideal position is found. Exact copies of the bones are made from the CT images of the patient. These resin copies of the real bones are placed in the motion model, reproducing the real patient&#x2019;s knee flexion. The model shows the implantation result with respect to the operation plan and the patient&#x2019;s kinematics.

Virtual models of all 42 positions were created using suitable computer software. Each virtual model was aligned to a newly defined anatomically based Cartesian coordinate system. The angular rotations around the 3 coordinate system axes were calculated directly from the aligned virtual models using rigid body kinematics and found to be equally accurate for the 3 methods. The 3 rotations in each knee could be depicted using anatomy-based diagrams for all 3 methods. We conclude that the 3 methods of data acquisition are equally and adequately accurate in vitro.

The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation).

Our model predicted tibiofemoral contact force with reasonable accuracy in both subjects. This model can be a very useful tool to predict the effect of surgical techniques and component alignment on contact forces.

The cartilage layer (including the meniscus) is about 1.44 mm, and the epiphyseal layer is about 2.25 mm, which conforms to the actual situation of rat knees. From the 3D images, the structure of the meniscus and the epiphyseal bone can be observed. The epiphyseal bone line is also particularly obvious. Simultaneously, the epiphyseal bone also has a mesh structure, which has the characteristics of both cartilage and tibia.

The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics (ISB).

In many cases, they overestimate the instrument gap, resulting in damaging to the knee joint by pushing instruments through a gap that is too small. We used cadaveric experiments to inform the noise induced by the sensors and image processing steps, to derive an error point-cloud in a simulated environment.

We selected studies by screening. We extracted data from selected RCTs, and analyzed RCTs by using Cochrane's Risk of bias criteria. Results 386 studies are searched, and 7 RCTs are selected. According to the study, several kinds of Korean Medicine such as hydrotherapy, decoction, acupuncture, moxibustion, and manual therapy are used with CPM therapy for the knee joint postoperative rehabilitation. We found the encouraging evidence that Korean Medicine and CPM combined therapy is more effective than single CPM therapy by alleviating pain, increasing range of motion, and improving knee function, etc. H"

         "<P>Although conventional radiography is the method most frequently used for monitoring progression of osteoarthritis, it may not show osteoarthritic changes of the knee until late in the disease, and it may show involvement of only one or two compartments in patients who have tricompartmental disease. We compared radiography, CT, and MR imaging for assessing the extent and severity of osteoarthritis of the knee in 20 patients. Radiography included posteroanterior weight-bearing, true lateral, and sunrise patellar projections. Axial CT scans were reformatted in sagittal and coronal planes. MR imaging consisted of spin-echo (600-800/20; 2000/60, 120 [TR/TE]), and gradient-echo (600/30, theta = 30 degrees) sequences. The severity of osteoarthritic changes was graded from 0 to 3. MR frequently showed tricompartmental cartilage loss when radiography and CT showed only bicompartmental involvement in the medial and patellofemoral compartments. In the lateral compartment, MR showed a higher pr"

Methods : We treated 3 patients who had knee joint pain and gait disturbance by knee injuries with Korean medicine and CPM treatment. We evaluated the outcomes by checking NRS, ROM, Lysholm knee score, walking state and other symptoms. Results : The NRS, ROM, Lysholm knee score, and other symptoms of 3 patients were improved before they. These results show possibilities of simultaneous treatment of Korean medicine and CPM. But there is a limit that the number of cases is not sufficient, and there was no long-term follow-up after discharge. Conclusions : Simultaneous treatment of Korean medicine and CPM has an effect on knee joint rehabilitation. Further studies are needed to prove the effectiveness of Korean medicine combined with CPM."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cuboid (3- or 6-mm-long sides) osseous and cartilaginous bodies were implanted in 16 cadaveric knee specimens. MR imaging was performed with T1-weighted spin-echo (SE), T2-weighted SE, proton-density-weighted SE, gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS), and spoiled GRASS sequences. MR arthrography was performed in two phases with saline and 2 mmol/L gadopentetate dimeglumine. CT and CT arthrography were performed in the transaxial plane. RESULTS: MR arthrography yielded the highest accuracy for the detection of osseous and cartilaginous bodies combined (92%) and was significantly (P < .01) better than MR imaging (57%-70%), CT arthrography (80%), and CT (74%).

Sixty-four of these knees were subsequently evaluated with diagnostic arthroscopy. In this group, CT was superior to MR imaging for meniscus evaluation in 29.7% of the knees, equal to MR in 54.7%, and inferior to MR in 15.6%. Although surface-coil MR imaging shows great promise and has numerous advantages over more conventional techniques, this preliminary experience suggests that, at least with certain imaging equipment and techniques, CT may be slightly more efficacious than 0.5-T MR imaging in meniscus evaluation. However, further comparative studies at higher field strengths are needed before the relative roles of CT and MR imaging can be established.</P>"

We therefore found it interesting to investigate this further by looking at the level of agreement between different imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the level of agreement between the three radiological modalities, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and digital radiography (DR), in assessing the ossification of the epiphyses of the knee. A total of 34 deceased individuals of 10&#x2013;25 years of age, brought in for a medicolegal autopsy at our department, were scanned by CT, MRI, and DR.

         "<P>Over the past few years, osteoarthritis is one of the most common knee diseases. The diagnosis and treatment of this disease is a vital importance. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown a good performance in learning the high-level features and in resolving segmentation issues. In this paper, we propose a new model of DL 3D-Res-UNet in order to accurately segment the knee cartilage from a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3D construction that allows perfectly visualizing the anatomical structure of this organ. This model is a combination of an architecture widely known in the literature for its segmentation efficiency (3D-UNet) with a residual architecture (3D-ResNet). The experimental results reveal that the suggested model can stabilize the training model, segment the cartilage from MRI very well and compete with the state of art on multiple performance metrics. The gain of precision and recall with 3DRes-UNet is given up to 15% and 26% compared to 3D-ResNet and 3D-"

         "CT imaging for the investigation of subchondral bone in knee osteoarthritis",
         "<P>In osteoarthritis, magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice to image articular cartilage and 'bone marrow lesions.' However, the calcified cartilage, the subchondral bone plate, and trabecular subchondral bone that are mineralized tissues strongly attenuate X-rays and are therefore potentially accessible for analyses using computed tomography (CT). CT images nicely show osseous cardinal signs of advanced osteoarthritis such as osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and subchondral bone sclerosis. But more importantly, CT can help us to better understand the pathophysiology of knee osteoarthritis from the measurement of the density and structure of subchondral mineralized tissues in vivo. For that purpose, we recently developed dedicated image analysis software called Medical Image Analysis Framework (MIAF)-Knee. In this manuscript, our aims are to present current knowledge on CT imaging of the subchondral bone in knee osteoarthritis and to provide a brief introduction to basic te"

A large number of studies have attempted to estimate forces around the knee during various activities. Several approaches have been used to relate knee kinematics and external forces to internal joint contact forces, the most popular being inverse dynamics, forward dynamics, and static body analyses. Knee forces have also been measured in vivo after knee arthroplasty, which serves as valuable validation of computational predictions. This review summarizes the results of published studies that measured knee forces for various activities. The efficacy of various methods to alter knee force distribution, such as gait modification, orthotics, walking aids, and custom treadmills are analyzed. Current gaps in our knowledge are identified and directions for future research in this area are outlined. </P>"

Imaging modalities used to date for its evaluation have limitations in their ability to fully characterize intra-articular crystal deposition. Since Computed Tomography (CT) imaging provides excellent visualization of bones and calcified tissue, in this pilot project we evaluated the utility of CT scan in describing intra-articular calcium crystal deposition in the knees. Method: We included 12 subjects with and four subjects without radiographic chondrocalcinosis in the most recent visit from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) study, which is a longitudinal cohort of community-dwelling older adults with or at risk for knee OA. All subjects underwent CT scans of bilateral knees. Each knee was divided into 25 subregions and each subregion was read for presence of calcium crystals by a musculoskeletal radiologist. To assess reliability, readings were repeated 4 weeks later. Results: CT images permit"

         "<P>The statistical shape model (SSM) method that uses 2D images of the knee joint to predict the three-dimensional (3D) joint surface model has been reported in the literature. In this study, we constructed a SSM database using 152 human computed tomography (CT) knee joint models, including the femur, tibia and patella and analysed the characteristics of each principal component of the SSM. The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation). The computational time for each bone of the knee joint was within 30?s using a personal computer.

         "Knee forces are highly relevant to performance after total knee arthroplasty especially during high flexion activities such as squatting. We constructed subject-specific models of two patients implanted with instrumented knee prostheses that measured knee forces in vivo. In vivo peak forces ranged from 2.2 to 2.3 times bodyweight but peaked at different flexion angles based on the type of squatting activity. Our model predicted tibiofemoral contact force with reasonable accuracy in both subjects. This model can be a very useful tool to predict the effect of surgical techniques and component alignment on contact forces. In addition, this model could be used for implant design development, to enhance knee function, to predict forces generated during other activities, and for predicting clinical outcomes."

In the second part, 3D-CAD models are generated from the results of the segmentation stage. The finite element analysis is done by first extracting the prosthetic implants from the reconstructed 3D-CAD model, then do a finite element analysis of these implants under objectively determined conditions such as; forces, allowed displacements, the materials composing implant, and the coefficient of friction.

Methods We searched 2 Korean medical electronic databases, and 2 Chinese electronic databases to find randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that treat knee injuries with Korean Medicine combined with CPM therapy. We selected studies by screening. We extracted data from selected RCTs, and analyzed RCTs by using Cochrane's Risk of bias criteria. Results 386 studies are searched, and 7 RCTs are selected. According to the study, several kinds of Korean Medicine such as hydrotherapy, decoction, acupuncture, moxibustion, and manual therapy are used with CPM therapy for the knee joint postoperative rehabilitation. We found the encouraging evidence that Korean Medicine and CPM combined therapy is more effective than single CPM therapy by alleviating pain, increasing range of motion, and improving knee function, etc. H"

Methods : We treated 3 patients who had knee joint pain and gait disturbance by knee injuries with Korean medicine and CPM treatment. We evaluated the outcomes by checking NRS, ROM, Lysholm knee score, walking state and other symptoms. Results : The NRS, ROM, Lysholm knee score, and other symptoms of 3 patients were improved before they. These results show possibilities of simultaneous treatment of Korean medicine and CPM. But there is a limit that the number of cases is not sufficient, and there was no long-term follow-up after discharge. Conclusions : Simultaneous treatment of Korean medicine and CPM has an effect on knee joint rehabilitation. Further studies are needed to prove the effectiveness of Korean medicine combined with CPM."

Three fresh cadaver knees were imaged at 6 flexion angles between 0&#x00B0; and 120&#x00B0; by MRI, a combination of RSA and CT and 3D digitisation (in two knees). Virtual models of all 42 positions were created using suitable computer software. Each virtual model was aligned to a newly defined anatomically based Cartesian coordinate system. The angular rotations around the 3 coordinate system axes were calculated directly from the aligned virtual models using rigid body kinematics and found to be equally accurate for the 3 methods. The 3 rotations in each knee could be depicted using anatomy-based diagrams for all 3 methods. We conclude that the 3 methods of data acquisition are equally and adequately accurate in vitro. MRI may be the most useful in vivo.</P>"

The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics (ISB).

         "Objective: Role of intra-articular calcium crystals in osteoarthritis (OA) is unclear. Imaging modalities used to date for its evaluation have limitations in their ability to fully characterize intra-articular crystal deposition. Since Computed Tomography (CT) imaging provides excellent visualization of bones and calcified tissue, in this pilot project we evaluated the utility of CT scan in describing intra-articular calcium crystal deposition in the knees. Method: We included 12 subjects with and four subjects without radiographic chondrocalcinosis in the most recent visit from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) study, which is a longitudinal cohort of community-dwelling older adults with or at risk for knee OA. All subjects underwent CT scans of bilateral knees. Each knee was divided into 25 subregions and each subregion was read for presence of calcium crystals by a musculoskeletal radiologist. To assess reliability, readings were repeated 4 weeks later. Results: CT images permit"

A dataset including patients with unilateral knee or hip osteoarthritis, cervical or lumbar spinal stenosis, and healthy controls was compiled. All participants performed a gait analysis comprising approximately 30 steps at their self-selected preferred walking speed. Spatiotemporal parameters and ankle, knee and hip kinematic trajectories were captured using the inertial sensor system RehaGait® (RehaGait Hasomed GmbH, Magbedurg, Germany). Data of 254 participants were extracted from the laboratory database projects.

         "Fat pad syndrome is a knee joint condition/disease where acute or chronic inflammation occurs in the fat pad of the knee joint, and it is a cause of anterior knee pain. Fat pad syndrome usually occurs concurrently with other conditions/diseases to collectively cause anterior knee pain. No study to date has reported the treatment of anterior knee pain solely due to fat pad syndrome. Here, we report a case of fat pad syndrome of the knee joint as the sole cause of anterior knee pain in a 49-year-old woman who received integrated Korean medicine treatments (pharmacopuncture, acupuncture, herbal medicine, deep fascial meridian therapy, and chuna). Using patient-reported pain scale scores, the level of the patient's pain was relieved, and her mobility improved. Integrated Korean medicine treatments could be effective for patients who have fat pad syndrome of the knee joint."

Koreans, however, do not have their own knee joint model used in the total knee replacement arthroplasty. They have to use European and American models but they do not match to Korean's knee joint components. Past days many doctors actually measured the knee joint shape using calipers while operating patients or the size of 2D image-like as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance image. Recently, three-dimensional visualization techniques are found to be useful in a wide range of medical applications. Three-dimensional imaging studies such as CT and MRI provide the primary source of patient-specific data. In this study, three dimensional knee joint models were constructed by image processing of CT data for 15 persons. Using the constructed model, the size of knee joint of Korean was measured. Finally this study proposed the method and standard of measurement by using 3D knee joint model. The proposed 3D model and data and method of measurement can be helpful to develop Korean knee implant and analysis of knee joint movement."

         "<P> Knee joint implants developed by western companies have been imported to Korea and used for Korean patients. However, many clinical problems occur in knee joints of Korean patients after total knee joint replacement owing to the geometric mismatch between the western implants and Korean knee joint structures. To solve these problems, a method to determine the representative dimension parameter values of Korean knee joints is introduced to aid in the design of knee joint implants appropriate for Korean patients. Measurements of the dimension parameters of 88 male Korean knee joint subjects were carried out. The distribution of the subjects versus each measured parameter value was investigated. The measured dimension parameter values of each parameter were grouped by suitable intervals called the &ldquo;size group,&rdquo; and average values of the size groups were calculated. The knee joint subjects were grouped as the &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; based on &ldquo;size group numbers&rdquo; of each parameter. From the iterative calculations to decrease the errors between the average dimension parameter values of each &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; and the dimension parameter values of the subjects, the average dimension parameter values that give less than the error criterion were determined to be the representative dimension parameter values for designing knee joint implants for Korean patients. </P>"

         "Ambulatory measurement of 3D knee joint angle",
         "Three-dimensional measurement of joint motion is a promising tool for clinical evaluation and therapeutic treatment comparisons. Although many devices exist for joints kinematics assessment, there is a need for a system that could be used in routine practice. Such a system should be accurate, ambulatory, and easy to use. The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics (ISB). A simple method based on a leg movement is proposed here to align two inertial measurement units fixed on the thigh and shank segments. Based on the combination of the former alignment and a fusion algorithm, the three-dimensional knee joint angle is measured and compared with a magnetic motion capture system during walking. The proposed system is suitable to measure the absolute knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction angles with mean (SD) offset errors of -1<SUP>o</SUP> (1<SUP>o</SUP>) and 0<SUP>o</SUP> (0.6<SUP>o</SUP>) and mean (SD) root mean square (RMS) errors of 1.5<SUP>o</SUP> (0.4<SUP>o</SUP>) and 1.7<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The system is also suitable for the relative measurement of knee internal/external rotation (mean (SD) offset error of 3.4<SUP>o</SUP> (2.7<SUP>o</SUP>)) with a mean (SD) RMS error of 1.6<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The method described in this paper can be easily adapted in order to measure other joint angular displacements such as elbow or ankle."

         "Anatomical and biomechanical assessment of the anterolateral ligament of the knee joint : a Korean cadaveric study using a triaxial accelerometer",
         "Introduction&amp;#xD; The anterolateral ligament (ALL) has recently been thought to play an important role in the rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). However, there are still some controversies in the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL. The purpose of this study was to investigate anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL using Korean cadaveric knee joints. We investigated the effect of ALL injury on its footprint distances under various knee conditions and assessed three-dimensional functional stability tests (pivot-shift and Lachmann tests) using a noninvasive triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Materials and Methods&amp;#xD; 20 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were dissected by a single surgeon. The locations of the tibial and femoral footprints of the ALL were recorded with respect to the lateral femoral epicondyle, tip of the fibular head, and Gerdy’s tubercle. The distance between the footprints were recorded in a normal knee condition. All cadavers were tested in neutral, internal, and external rotation at 30°, 60°, 90° of knee flexion. The pivot shift and Lachmann tests were measured using a triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA). Serial sectioning of the ALL and the ACL was performed after testing in normal knee joints. Measurements were collected before and after each sectioning.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Results&amp;#xD; Anatomical features of the current study were similar to those of previous cadaveric studies. The prevalence of the ALL in our study was 100%. Average distance of the tibial footprint to the tip of the fibular head was 19.85 ± 3.41 mm and to Gerdy’s tubercle was 18.3 ± 4.19mm. Average distance of the femoral footprint to the lateral femoral epicondyle was 10.25 ± 2.97mm. The footprint distance of the ALL was the longest at 30° of knee flexion (47.83 ± 8.05 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001) in a normal knee neutral rotation condition. An internal rotational force produced statistically significant increases in footprint distances in normal knees at all three knee flexion angles. During internal rotation, the footprint distance was also the longest at 30° of knee flexion (50.05 ± 8.88 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although an internal rotational force did not produce a statistically significant increase in the footprint distance after ALL transection, it increased the footprint distance at all three knee flexion angles after a combined ACL and ALL transection (p = 0.022). After a combined ACL and ALL transection, the footprint distance was the longest at 30° of knee flexion under internal rotational force (52.05 ± 7.60 mm). Pivot shift and Lachmann tests measured by the KiRA device did not show statistically significant differences between normal and ALL-transected knees. However, there were significant differences in the combined ACL-ALL-transected knees compared with normal and ALL-transected knees (p&amp;lt;0.001).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Conclusion&amp;#xD; The ALL was identified as a distinct ligament structure in this Korean cadaveric study. Considering the footprint distances of the ALL in various knee conditions, the ALL is thought to play a protective role in internal rotational stability especially at 30° of knee flexion. Isolated ALL transection did not show significant effects on the ALL footprint distances and functional stability tests. The ALL is thought to act as a secondary supportive stabilizer for rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the ACL.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Keywords: knee joint, anterolateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament, rotatory instability, KiRA, anterolateral ligament reconstruction, Korean cadaver&amp;#xD;"

Virtual models of all 42 positions were created using suitable computer software. Each virtual model was aligned to a newly defined anatomically based Cartesian coordinate system. The angular rotations around the 3 coordinate system axes were calculated directly from the aligned virtual models using rigid body kinematics and found to be equally accurate for the 3 methods. The 3 rotations in each knee could be depicted using anatomy-based diagrams for all 3 methods. We conclude that the 3 methods of data acquisition are equally and adequately accurate in vitro.

The two-dimensional images are registered to the three-dimensional (3D) model for high efficiency.

Mimics 10.0 was used to reconstruct the bone structure, ligament, and meniscus according to the pulse diffusion-weighted imaging sequence (PDWI) and stir sequences of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Excluding congenital malformations and diseases of the skeletal muscle system, MRI scanning was performed on bilateral knee joints. Proton weighted sequence (PDWI sequence) and stir pulse sequence were selected for MRI. The models were imported into Geomagic Studio 11 software for refinement and modification, and 3D registration of bone structure and main soft tissue structure was performed to construct a digital model of knee joint bone structure and accessory cartilage and ligament structure. The 3D knee joint model including bone, meniscus, and collateral ligament was established. Reconstruction and image registration based on mimics and Geomagic Studio can build a 3D model of knee joint with satisfactory morphology, which can meet the requirements of teaching, motion simulation, and biomechanical analysis.</P>"

In this study, we constructed a SSM database using 152 human computed tomography (CT) knee joint models, including the femur, tibia and patella and analysed the characteristics of each principal component of the SSM. The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation). The computational time for each bone of the knee joint was within 30?s using a personal computer. The analysis of this study indicated that the SSM method could be a useful tool to construct 3D surface models of the knee with sub-millimeter accuracy in real time.

The point cloud data of each component can be imported into a reverse engineering software like Geomagic Studio (Raindrop Geomagic, Research Triangle Park, NC) where it can be converted into a CAD model. After obtaining CAD models of all three components- femoral component, bearing component, and tibial component, they can be assembled in a CAD software like Solidworks or Catia like Kanyal(2021) did.

December 2021; 15(4): 041004. Andreassen, T. E., Hume, D. R., Hamilton, L. D., Hegg, S.L., Higinbotham, S. E., and Shelburne, K. B. \\Validation of Subject-Specific Knee Models from In Vivo Measurements.\\ ASME. *J. Biomech, Engineering*. ## Code The code provided is contained in the \\Working Models\\ and the \\Processing Code\\ Folders. The optimization of the model can be run by running the \\Lig_Calibration.m\\ file in the \\Optimization Full\\ folder. The code will run the Abaqus trials specified by the \\JOBNAMES\\ and \\JOBLIST\\ files. Values for the ligament parameters will be updated in the \\Lig-Parameters.inp\\ file according to the current trial for the optimization. Kinematics will be extracted using the .py files and then the errors of these will be compared against the known laxity kinematics in the \\Data_Processed_2.mat\\ file. The global cost will be calculated according to the weights in the \\Weight.xlsx\\ file. Then the new set of design variables will be calculated and used to update the \\Lig-Parameters.inp\\ file. The optimization will continue until manually stopped o convergence within a tolerance is reached. To view experimental results of a given trial following optimization, the chosen parameters are update in the \\AMP_TEST.inp\\ file for the knee flexion angle, and the desired loads. These are updated by changing the parameters of the \\TF_KIN_STEP2_CYLINDRICAL_FE\\ and the \\TF_LOAD_STEP2_\\ variables. Then the model can be run using the terminal on the \\MAIN_TEST.inp\\ file. Lastly, results can be extracted using the \\GET_ODB_Step_Info.m\\ script in the \\Processing Code\\ folder and choosing the correct ODB file, and whether the portion you are interested in is the \\LAXITY\\ step or the \\FLEXION\\ step. ## Description of the data and file structure This dataset represents original data from the work to validate the reproducibility of knee models based on the datasets used to build them. The files contained include Imaging Data, Knee Laxity Data, Optimization Code and Models, Processing Code, and Results. The imaging data provided include imaging and segmentation for the CT and MRI scans. Additional surface scans with color texture are provided as surface obj. The models were created in Abaqus Explicit and are provided as .inp files. All optimization and results are extracted using a combination of MATLAB and Python scripts. The .mhd files, together with the .raw files, are segmentation files that can be used in segmentation software such as 3D Slicer, Materialize Mimics, or Simpleware ScanIP. The .stl files and the .obj (.obj and .mtl and .png together) are 3D geometries representing the outer meshed as triangulated surfaces. The .stl files only contain the geometry, while the .obj files include the original color of the vertices in the .mtl and the .png files. Stl and obj files can be opened and manipulated in software such as MeshMixer, MeshLab, or HyperWorks Hypermesh. **Imaging Data - Original Cadaveric Specimen Images used for the creation of 3D geometries via segmentation** 1.

         "<P>This is the first investigation to validate the accuracy of spatial measurements based on computer-generated three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of CT and magnetic resonance (MR) scans. Standard 3D reconstructions of one fresh frozen cadaveric knee specimen with implanted stereotactic reference markers were created. These reconstructions were based on the data from CT and MR scans performed before and after the resection of extraosseous soft tissues. The distances between the stereotactic reference markers in the 3D reconstructions were compared with the same measurements of the specimen using a Bridgeport milling machine as a precision 3D digitizer. The accuracy of intermarker distance measurements averaged 99% for CT-based reconstructions compared with 97.5% for MR-based reconstructions. Planar slices at a predetermined level and orientation through the femoral condyles were created by sequential milling of the specimen and were compared with reconstructed oblique planar CT and MR slices at the same level and orientation. The accuracy of condylar dimensional measurements was 94% for CT and 93% for MR compared with measurements of the milled slices. Three-dimensional reconstructions based on CT and MR scan data were of equally high quality and were unaffected by the status of the soft tissues.</P>"

         "Two separate themes are presented in this paper. Aims: The first theme is to present a graphical modeling approach of human anatomical structures namely, the femur and the tibia. The second theme involves making a finite element analysis of stresses, displacements and deformations in prosthetic implants (the femoral implant and the polyethylene insert). Objectives: The graphical modeling approach comes in two parts. The first is the segmentation of MRI scanned images, retrieved in DICOM format for edge detection. In the second part, 3D-CAD models are generated from the results of the segmentation stage. The finite element analysis is done by first extracting the prosthetic implants from the reconstructed 3D-CAD model, then do a finite element analysis of these implants under objectively determined conditions such as; forces, allowed displacements, the materials composing implant, and the coefficient of friction. Conclusion: The objective of this work is to implement an interface for exchanging data between 2D MRI images obtained from a medical diagnosis of a patient and the 3D-CAD model used in various applications, such as; the extraction of the implants, stress analysis at the knee joint and can serve as an aid to surgery, also predict the behavior of the prosthetic implants vis-a-vis the forces acting on the knee joints."

These differences have realized the need of developing a gender-specific prosthesis. However, anatomical studies on gender-based differences in the proximal tibial plateau's sagittal curvature have rarely been conducted. Therefore, this study is aimed at evaluating the geometry of the sagittal curvature of the proximal tibial plateau in the Korean population. </P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P> Three-dimensional data for the sagittal curvature of the tibial plateau morphology from 1976 patients (i.e., 299 male and 1677 female) were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. The sagittal profiles of the tibial plateaus were also evaluated. The independent <I>t</I>-test and paired <I>t</I>-test were used for statistical analysis. </P><P><B>Results</B></P><P> The proximal tibia had concave and convex surfaces in the medial and lateral plateaus, respectively, for both genders. In addition, the medial diameter of the tibial plateau was significantly greater than the lateral diameter for both genders. Gender-based difference was not found in the medial diameter of the tibial plateau but was observed in the lateral diameter. </P><P><B>Conclusion</B></P><P> These results may provide guidelines for a suitable knee implant design for the Korean patients. The incorporation of this shape information in the medial and lateral sides in the prosthetics for a total knee arthroplasty and a lateral unicompartmental knee arthroplasty can improve knee range motion.</P>"

         "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The application of 3D printing patient specific instrumentation model in total knee arthroplasty was explored to improve the operative accuracy and safety of artificial total knee arthroplasty. In this study, a total of 52 patients who need knee replacement were selected as the study objects, and 52 patients were divided into experimental group and control group. First, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA), lateral femoral angle (LFA), hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), femorotibial angle (FTA) of research objects in both groups were measured. Then, the blood loss during the operations, drainage volume after operations, total blood loss, hidden blood loss, and hemoglobin decrease of the experiment group and the control group were measured and calculated. Finally, the postoperative outcomes of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty were evaluated. The results showed that before the operations, in the PSI group, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA) was (6.9 &plusmn; 2.4)&deg;, the lateral femoral angle (LFA) was (82.4 &plusmn; 1.6)&deg;, the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) was (166.4 &plusmn; 1.4)&deg;, and the femorotibial angle (FTA) was (179.5 &plusmn; 7.3)&deg;. In the CON group, the FMAA was (5.8 &plusmn; 2.4)&deg;, the LFA was (81.3 &plusmn; 2.1)&deg;, the HKA was (169.5 &plusmn; 1.9)&deg;, and the FTA was (185.4 &plusmn; 5.4)&deg;. The differences in these data between the two groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). After the operations, in the PSI group, the total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, and the hemoglobin (Hb) decrease were respectively (420.2 &plusmn; 210.5), (240.5 &plusmn; 234.5), and (1.7 &plusmn; 0.9); in the CON group, the total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, and the Hb decrease were respectively (782.1 &plusmn; 340.4), (450.9 &plusmn; 352.6), and (2.9 &plusmn; 1.0). These data of both groups were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Therefore, it can be seen that the 3D printing patient specific instrumentation model can effectively simulate the lower limb coronal force line and was highly consistent of the preoperative software simulation plan. In addition, the random interviews of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty showed that the knees of patients had recovered well. The application of 3D printing patient specific instrumentation model in artificial total knee arthroplasty can effectively improve the operative accuracy and safety, and the clinical therapeutic effects were significant.</P>"

         "<P>Objective To provide normal reference value for traumatic disease of the knee by measuring menisci and ligaments of knee in normal adults. Methods MR examination was performed in the knee of 5a healthy volunteers respectively. The MR imaging parameter includes T1WI, T2WI and PDWI-I-T2WI sequence in sagittal, coronal position. The measuring date of meniscus, anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament and the lateral collateral ligament were obtained and compared with the results of the cadaver published in the related anatomic literature. The regression relationship between the body of meniscus, the width of tibial plateau and the weight of volunteer were analyzed statistically. Of the volunteers, 13 were performed with T2WI and PDWI fat saturation sequence scan, analyzed and compared the advantage of the two sequences in demonstrating the meniscus and ligament. Results The values of menisci measured in MRI were larger than the corresponding values in cadaver reported literature. The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus was thicker than the others. There was linear regression among the width of medial meniscus body, the width of the tibial plateau, and the body weight. The angle between ACI. and Blumensaat＇s line was less than 15° The PCI. angle was （120.89±5.63）°. Conclusion The measuring value of the knee by MRI reflects the information in vivo more accurately than the means of cadaver, it can provide the normal reference value for traumatic disease of the knee clinically. Linear regression equation may be constructed among the width of the medial meniscus body, the width of the tibial plateau and the body weight. MRI, especially T2WI and PDWI fat saturation sequence play an important role in demonstrating the structure of the knee joint.</P>"

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Voluntary participants of 81 cases, physically normal and free from knee joint disease at present or in the past, were chosen for our research program. The subjects were divided into young, middle and old age group respectively for the male and female; and articular cartilage thickness using MRI were measured. RESULT: Each of the three groups reveals the tendency of decrease in the thickness of the knee joint cartilage in all of the age groups along with the increase of the age. The cartilage thickness according to age for both sex, except for the tibial medial condyle, decreased significantly. For the male subjects, the degree of decrease in cartilage thicknes indicates difference in each sections. However, in case of female, the change of articular cartilage thickness in overall sections showed more significantly decreased in young to middle age group than in middle to old age group. CONCLUSION: The results revealed the normal articular cartilage thickness of knee and time that the thickness of articular cartilage was decreased with age. And we could evaluate the severity of degenerative change of articular cartilage by comparison to normal articular cartilage thickness."

The assembly of Total Knee Replacement components with Femur and Tibia bones at hyperflexion of knee can be visualized; it consists of Femoral component, Bearing component, Tibial component, Femur and Tibia. The CAD models of Total Knee Replacement components were developed using reverse engineering technique. CAD of Femur and Tibia bones were developed using MRI images of an Indian patient. Resection of Femur and Tibia was accomplished with the help of a professional surgeon from Apollo Hospital, Bangalore. The final assembly of Total Knee Replacement components with Femur and Tibia bones was executed in Solidworks [1]. This method is same as published by Kanyal [2]. The assembled model (ASSEMBLY.x_t, or ASSEMBLY.IGS) presented here can be imported to any CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) software like Hypermesh [3], Abaqus [4], Ansys [5] etc. for executing a finite element analysis which might be very crucial for throwing light into knee kinematics and mechanics at hyperflexion of the knee.

         "Knee forces are highly relevant to performance after total knee arthroplasty especially during high flexion activities such as squatting. We constructed subject-specific models of two patients implanted with instrumented knee prostheses that measured knee forces in vivo. In vivo peak forces ranged from 2.2 to 2.3 times bodyweight but peaked at different flexion angles based on the type of squatting activity. Our model predicted tibiofemoral contact force with reasonable accuracy in both subjects. This model can be a very useful tool to predict the effect of surgical techniques and component alignment on contact forces. In addition, this model could be used for implant design development, to enhance knee function, to predict forces generated during other activities, and for predicting clinical outcomes."

         "A 3D Printed Mechanical Model of the Knee to Detect and Avoid Total Knee Replacement Surgery Errors",
         "<P>In this article, a novel 3D printed knee model for detecting possible errors in the planning and treatment of total knee replacement surgery is presented. This method is a first step towards automation of prosthesis placement. Thanks to the mathematically computed four-bar mechanism, it is now possible to emulate the implant insertion before the operation. This model allows the surgeon to fit the prosthesis to the patient&#x2019;s knee and to verify if the mounted position is optimal. This process can be repeated until the ideal position is found. Exact copies of the bones are made from the CT images of the patient. These resin copies of the real bones are placed in the motion model, reproducing the real patient&#x2019;s knee flexion. The model shows the implantation result with respect to the operation plan and the patient&#x2019;s kinematics. The experiment carried out on a patient&#x2019;s model according to the standard implantation shows a lift-off and sliding effect of the femoral component outside the joint area. However, this phenomenon is easily resolved if the femoral component is implanted about half a centimeter lateral to the knee&#x2019;s coronal axis. Until now, no medical research had questioned the lateral positioning of the prosthesis. This knee model provides an understanding of the important biomechanical parameters for total knee replacement surgery. This model will have a significant contribution to secure the surgery&#x2019;s success, increase patient satisfaction and reduce the overall number of revisions.</P>"

         "Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is a permanent solution for arthritis in the knee joint; the infected knee is replaced with biocompatible components of TKR. After this surgery the patient can resume everyday activities with normal functioning of the knee. Total Knee Replacement has three components- femoral component, bearing, and tibial component. These components are fixed to Femur and Tibia with a strong cement (Kanyal, 2020). Finite element analysis or CAE analysis can be used to simulate the dynamics of TKR with knee joint. The CAE model of a posterior-stabilized, fixed bearing total knee prosthesis, PFC Sigma (De Puy, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leeds, UK) assembled along with Femur and Tibia bones is presented here. Kanyal(2021) developed a CAD model for TKR components with knee joint which could be used to further develop a finite element model of the TRK components with knee joint, however, an already meshed CAE model is presented here representing the same CAD as Kanyal(2021) developed which will help to save time and effort; brick or hex meshing (meshing a solid with brick elements or hex elements) takes considerable time and effort. The bearing component is the most critical component in a TKR as it is prone to wear and therefore failure. Godest et al (2002), and Zelle et al (2009) also used hex elements to mesh bearing component in CAE analysis. Meshing of Femur bone, Tibia bone, and Femoral component is done with three noded tria elements, however the Tibial component is meshed with hex elements. The meshing of TKR components, Femur and Tibia bones is executed in Hypermesh 13 (Altair Engineering, Inc., Troy, MI, USA). The CAE meshed model(cae.hm) can be opened in Hypermesh 13 (Altair Engineering, Inc., Troy, MI, USA) for further model development like defining material properties, section properties, contact definitions etc. , then it can be exported to a CAE solver as .inp file for analysis and post processing.

We therefore found it interesting to investigate this further by looking at the level of agreement between different imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the level of agreement between the three radiological modalities, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and digital radiography (DR), in assessing the ossification of the epiphyses of the knee. A total of 34 deceased individuals of 10&#x2013;25 years of age, brought in for a medicolegal autopsy at our department, were scanned by CT, MRI, and DR. The ossification stages of the three bones of the right knee, distal femoral, proximal tibial, and proximal fibular epiphysis were assessed using the established combined staging method by Schmeling et al. and Kellinghaus et al. Analysis of the results by Cohen&rsquo;s weighted kappa showed a good agreement between CT and DR (<I>K</I> = 0.61&#x2013;0.70), and MRI and DR (<I>K</I> = 0.68&#x2013;0.79) but only moderate agreement between CT and MRI (<I>K</I> = 0.55&#x2013;0.57). This leads us to conclude that different radiological images cannot be used interchangeably for age estimation purposes, so reference material needs to be imaging-modality specific.

         "Contact mechanics determine the outcomes of a Total Knee Replacement (TKR) surgery in which the infected knee joint of a human is replaced with Total Knee Replacement components made up of bio-compatible materials. To get valuable insights into the contact mechanics of knee joint, CAD (Computer Aided Design) and CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) analysis have proved very significant. Total Knee Replacement has three components- femoral component, bearing, and tibial component. These components are fixed to Femur and Tibia with a strong cement. The assembly of TKR components with Femur and Tibia bones is presented here as CAD. This CAD assembly can be used for any finite element analysis or CAE analysis concerning the knee joint. The TKR components of a posterior-stabilized, fixed bearing total knee prosthesis, PFC (De Puy, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leeds, UK)(1) were modelled using reverse engineering technique that converts a point cloud data gathered after scanning an actual physical product to CAD surfaces and solids. 3D point cloud data of TKR components were obtained with ATOS compact scanner (GOM GmbH, Germany) (2) consisting of two cameras, a laser source, a software and working area. The specifications of the scanner were: camera pixels: 8 or 12 mega- pixels, measuring area: 45 x 30 to 1200 x 1000 mm², working distance: 450 to 1200 mm and sensor dimension: 340 mm x 130 mm x 230 mm. The Geometric modelling of TKR component from these point cloud data was developed using Geomagic studio 12 (Raindrop Geomagic, Research Triangle Park, NC) (3). The bones, Femur and Tibia were modelled using point cloud data from MRI images of an Indian patient collected from Apollo hospital, Bangalore. The final assembly was executed in Solidworks 2013 (Dessault Systemes, Velizy-Villacoublay, France) (4). The resection of Femur and Tibia bone was accomplished with the help of a professional TKR surgeon at Apollo hospital, Bangalore The CAD model can be meshed in a CAE software and used to perform a CAE analysis be it a simple linear implicit analysis or a complex dynamic explicit analysis. The CAD (.stp format) needs an \\import\\ to the CAE software. All dimensions are in mm."

Methods We searched 2 Korean medical electronic databases, and 2 Chinese electronic databases to find randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) that treat knee injuries with Korean Medicine combined with CPM therapy. We selected studies by screening. We extracted data from selected RCTs, and analyzed RCTs by using Cochrane's Risk of bias criteria. Results 386 studies are searched, and 7 RCTs are selected. According to the study, several kinds of Korean Medicine such as hydrotherapy, decoction, acupuncture, moxibustion, and manual therapy are used with CPM therapy for the knee joint postoperative rehabilitation. We found the encouraging evidence that Korean Medicine and CPM combined therapy is more effective than single CPM therapy by alleviating pain, increasing range of motion, and improving knee function, etc. However, the risk of bias in most RCTs was judged to be uncertain. Conclusions Combination of Korean Medicine and CPM therapy can compensate the defect of single CPM therapy, and promotes the recovery of knee joint function."

Simulating the natural motion of the human knee in different terrains is useful for the design and performance assessment of the prosthetic knee. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to propose a four-bar knee joint measurement system which can simulate the natural knee motions to collect the kinetic parameters precisely and analyze the walking characteristics under different terrain conditions. METHODS: A low-cost four-bar knee joint mechanism was proposed and gait characteristics were assessed on level ground, ascending and descending stairs, and ascending and descending ramp. RESULTS: The initial knee flexion angle during stair ascent at heel strike is obviously larger than in other walking scenes. The stance phase accounts for 53% of a single gait cycle during stair descent, which is slightly lower than other walking scenarios. The period that both the hindfoot and forefoot contact the ground in ramp descent accounts for 18%, which is less than for the others. While the forefoot contacts the ground in ramp ascent, the maximum vertical ground reaction force of the forefoot occurs when the hindfoot and forefoot simultaneously contact the ground, whereas in other scenarios the forefoot contacts the ground solely. CONCLUSIONS: The four-bar knee joint can simulate the natural motion of the human knee accurately. The gait characteristics analysis of different walking scenarios indicated that the low-cost four-bar knee joint exoskeleton was suitable for human knee joint simulation.</P>"

We assigned eight test participants each to a physical therapy group (PTG) and an accelerated rehabilitation exercise group (AREG), and compared differences between the groups. Both the PTG and AREG showed significant increases in 30° away and 60° toward isometric strength after treatment. In addition, significant differences were observed in these strength tests between the two groups. Both groups also showed significant increases in thigh circumference, Lysholm score, and active balance agility after treatment, but no significant differences were observed between the two groups. We conclude that the ARE treatment was more effective for improving isometric strength of the knee joint than that of physical therapy, and that an active rehabilitation exercise program after ACLR had positive effects on recovery performance of patients with an ACL injury and their return to the playing field.</P>"

Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown a good performance in learning the high-level features and in resolving segmentation issues. In this paper, we propose a new model of DL 3D-Res-UNet in order to accurately segment the knee cartilage from a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3D construction that allows perfectly visualizing the anatomical structure of this organ. This model is a combination of an architecture widely known in the literature for its segmentation efficiency (3D-UNet) with a residual architecture (3D-ResNet). The experimental results reveal that the suggested model can stabilize the training model, segment the cartilage from MRI very well and compete with the state of art on multiple performance metrics. The gain of precision and recall with 3DRes-UNet is given up to 15% and 26% compared to 3D-ResNet and 3D-UNet, respectively, hence the effectiveness of the suggested method.</P>"

A dataset including patients with unilateral knee or hip osteoarthritis, cervical or lumbar spinal stenosis, and healthy controls was compiled. All participants performed a gait analysis comprising approximately 30 steps at their self-selected preferred walking speed. Spatiotemporal parameters and ankle, knee and hip kinematic trajectories were captured using the inertial sensor system RehaGait® (RehaGait Hasomed GmbH, Magbedurg, Germany). Data of 254 participants were extracted from the laboratory database projects. After checking for duplicates and removing data that did not pass the quality check, 206 participants remained in the final dataset, including 30 patients with unilateral knee ostoarthritis, 20 with unilateral hip osteoarthritis, 43 with lumbar spinal stenosis, 17 with cervical spinal stenosis, and 96 healthy controls. Discrete parameters were extracted for each step using an inhouse algorithm written in Matlab. Mean values for all parameters were calculated for each participant and side and used for further analysis. Sociodemographic data, spatiotemporal parameters, and calculated angles were collected in one dataset, which was then checked for missing values. Missing values of the healthy participants were filled with the mean angle of this group. Missing values in the patient group were filled using the nearest-neighbors method."

         "Development of a Full Flexion 3D Musculoskeletal Model of the Knee Considering Intersegmental Contact During High Knee Flexion Movements",
         "<P>A musculoskeletal model of the right lower limb was developed to estimate 3D tibial contact forces in high knee flexion postures. This model determined the effect of intersegmental contact between thigh-calf and heel-gluteal structures on tibial contact forces. This model includes direct tracking and 3D orientation of intersegmental contact force, femoral translations from in vivo studies, wrapping of knee extensor musculature, and a novel optimization constraint for multielement muscle groups. Model verification consisted of calculating the error between estimated tibial compressive forces and direct measurements from the Grand Knee Challenge during movements to &sim;120&deg; of knee flexion as no high knee flexion data are available. Tibial compression estimates strongly fit implant data during walking (<I>R</I><SUP>2</SUP> = .83) and squatting (<I>R</I><SUP>2</SUP> = .93) with a root mean squared difference of .47 and .16 body weight, respectively. Incorporating intersegmental contact significantly reduced model estimates of peak tibial anterior-posterior shear and increased peak medial-lateral shear during the static phase of high knee flexion movements by an average of .33 and .07 body weight, respectively. This model supports prior work in that intersegmental contact is a critical parameter when estimating tibial contact forces in high knee flexion movements across a range of culturally and occupationally relevant postures.</P>"

         "Objectives : The aim of this study was to report the cases of knee injury that are treated with both CPM and Korean medicine. Methods : We treated 3 patients who had knee joint pain and gait disturbance by knee injuries with Korean medicine and CPM treatment. We evaluated the outcomes by checking NRS, ROM, Lysholm knee score, walking state and other symptoms. Results : The NRS, ROM, Lysholm knee score, and other symptoms of 3 patients were improved before they. These results show possibilities of simultaneous treatment of Korean medicine and CPM. But there is a limit that the number of cases is not sufficient, and there was no long-term follow-up after discharge. Conclusions : Simultaneous treatment of Korean medicine and CPM has an effect on knee joint rehabilitation. Further studies are needed to prove the effectiveness of Korean medicine combined with CPM."

         "Objective To study the clinical application of dual-energy CT on the knee ligaments. Methods Twelve volunteers were scanned on the knee with dual-energy CT. Two-and three-dimensional images were used for displaying in all cases by means of MPR and VRT. Results The all tendons and partial ligaments of 24 knees, such as patella ligament, fibular collateral ligament, anterior curciate ligament （ACL） and posterior curciate ligament （PCL） were clearly displayed; the tibial collateral ligament was not displayed satisfactorily. The transversal ligaments, such as lateral patellar retinaculum and medial patellar retinaculum, and the posterior ligament, such as oblique popliteal ligament could not be showed clearly. Conclusion The dual-energy CT was a new and valuable tool to display the main ligaments of the knee."

         "Robotic Arthroscopy: The Uncertainty in Internal Knee Joint Measurement",
         "<P>We report a study that developed algorithms to measure the dimension and uncertainty range of free space inside the knee joint for the purpose of minimally invasive surgery. During knee arthroscopy, the patient's leg position is continuously adjusted to create the space for surgical instruments inside the joint. Surgeons 'feel' the force they apply to the leg and estimate the joint space from a 2D video. In many cases, they overestimate the instrument gap, resulting in damaging to the knee joint by pushing instruments through a gap that is too small. We used cadaveric experiments to inform the noise induced by the sensors and image processing steps, to derive an error point-cloud in a simulated environment. From the point-cloud, we calculate the instrument gap range inside the knee joint. For a selected surgical instrument gap size, the measurement algorithm is accurate to less than a millimetre. However, measurement errors introduce an uncertainty of 14%. The performance of our algorithms demonstrates the use of a single-lens arthroscope to measure the instrument gap to provide feedback to a surgeon or enable control of a robotic leg manipulator.</P>"
