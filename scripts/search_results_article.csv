The diagnosis and treatment of this disease is a vital importance. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown a good performance in learning the high-level features and in resolving segmentation issues. In this paper, we propose a new model of DL 3D-Res-UNet in order to accurately segment the knee cartilage from a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3D construction that allows perfectly visualizing the anatomical structure of this organ. This model is a combination of an architecture widely known in the literature for its segmentation efficiency (3D-UNet) with a residual architecture (3D-ResNet). The experimental results reveal that the suggested model can stabilize the training model, segment the cartilage from MRI very well and compete with the state of art on multiple performance metrics. The gain of precision and recall with 3DRes-UNet is given up to 15% and 26% compared to 3D-ResNet and 3D-UNet, respectively, hence the effectiveness of the suggested method.</P>","Hedi Bedoui, Mohamed",2,1,pp.1-7,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13614853,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13614853&type=mobile,,,3D knee model

In this study, we constructed a SSM database using 152 human computed tomography (CT) knee joint models, including the femur, tibia and patella and analysed the characteristics of each principal component of the SSM. The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation). The computational time for each bone of the knee joint was within 30?s using a personal computer. The analysis of this study indicated that the SSM method could be a useful tool to construct 3D surface models of the knee with sub-millimeter accuracy in real time.

This method is a first step towards automation of prosthesis placement. Thanks to the mathematically computed four-bar mechanism, it is now possible to emulate the implant insertion before the operation. This model allows the surgeon to fit the prosthesis to the patient&#x2019;s knee and to verify if the mounted position is optimal. This process can be repeated until the ideal position is found. Exact copies of the bones are made from the CT images of the patient. These resin copies of the real bones are placed in the motion model, reproducing the real patient&#x2019;s knee flexion. The model shows the implantation result with respect to the operation plan and the patient&#x2019;s kinematics. The experiment carried out on a patient&#x2019;s model according to the standard implantation shows a lift-off and sliding effect of the femoral component outside the joint area. However, this phenomenon is easily resolved if the femoral component is implanted about half a centimeter lateral to the knee&#x2019;s coronal axis. Until now, no medical research had questioned the lateral positioning of the prosthesis. This knee model provides an understanding of the important biomechanical parameters for total knee replacement surgery. This model will have a significant contribution to secure the surgery&#x2019;s success, increase patient satisfaction and reduce the overall number of revisions.</P>","Rottinger, Timon;Rottinger, Heinz;",2,1,pp.12501-12507,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13526087,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13526087&type=mobile,,,3D knee model

However, when implementing these measurements across multiple clinical centers, scanner variability becomes a critical consideration. Our purposes were to quantify and compare same-model variability (between repeated scans on the same MRI system) and cross-model variability (across different MRI systems) in knee cartilage thickness measurements using MRI scanners from five manufacturers, as analyzed with a specific 3D volume analysis software.</P></P><P>Methods<P>Ten healthy volunteers (eight males and two females, aged 22-60 years) underwent two scans of their right knee on 3T MRI systems from five manufacturers (Canon, Fujifilm, GE, Philips, and Siemens). The imaging protocol included fat-suppressed spoiled gradient echo and proton density weighted sequences.

Aims: The first theme is to present a graphical modeling approach of human anatomical structures namely, the femur and the tibia. The second theme involves making a finite element analysis of stresses, displacements and deformations in prosthetic implants (the femoral implant and the polyethylene insert). Objectives: The graphical modeling approach comes in two parts. The first is the segmentation of MRI scanned images, retrieved in DICOM format for edge detection. In the second part, 3D-CAD models are generated from the results of the segmentation stage. The finite element analysis is done by first extracting the prosthetic implants from the reconstructed 3D-CAD model, then do a finite element analysis of these implants under objectively determined conditions such as; forces, allowed displacements, the materials composing implant, and the coefficient of friction. Conclusion: The objective of this work is to implement an interface for exchanging data between 2D MRI images obtained from a medical diagnosis of a patient and the 3D-CAD model used in various applications, such as; the extraction of the implants, stress analysis at the knee joint and can serve as an aid to surgery, also predict the behavior of the prosthetic implants vis-a-vis the forces acting on the knee joints.","Djoudi, F.",2,1,pp.155-161,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jor.2013.09.009,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART68187596,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART68187596&type=mobile,3D-CAD model .

In this study, a total of 52 patients who need knee replacement were selected as the study objects, and 52 patients were divided into experimental group and control group. First, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA), lateral femoral angle (LFA), hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), femorotibial angle (FTA) of research objects in both groups were measured. Then, the blood loss during the operations, drainage volume after operations, total blood loss, hidden blood loss, and hemoglobin decrease of the experiment group and the control group were measured and calculated. Finally, the postoperative outcomes of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty were evaluated. The results showed that before the operations, in the PSI group, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA) was (6.9 &plusmn; 2.4)&deg;, the lateral femoral angle (LFA) was (82.4 &plusmn; 1.6)&deg;, the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) was (166.4 &plusmn; 1.4)&deg;, and the femorotibial angle (FTA) was (179.5 &plusmn; 7.3)&deg;.

This model determined the effect of intersegmental contact between thigh-calf and heel-gluteal structures on tibial contact forces. This model includes direct tracking and 3D orientation of intersegmental contact force, femoral translations from in vivo studies, wrapping of knee extensor musculature, and a novel optimization constraint for multielement muscle groups. Model verification consisted of calculating the error between estimated tibial compressive forces and direct measurements from the Grand Knee Challenge during movements to &sim;120&deg; of knee flexion as no high knee flexion data are available.

However, many clinical problems occur in knee joints of Korean patients after total knee joint replacement owing to the geometric mismatch between the western implants and Korean knee joint structures. To solve these problems, a method to determine the representative dimension parameter values of Korean knee joints is introduced to aid in the design of knee joint implants appropriate for Korean patients. Measurements of the dimension parameters of 88 male Korean knee joint subjects were carried out. The distribution of the subjects versus each measured parameter value was investigated. The measured dimension parameter values of each parameter were grouped by suitable intervals called the &ldquo;size group,&rdquo; and average values of the size groups were calculated. The knee joint subjects were grouped as the &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; based on &ldquo;size group numbers&rdquo; of each parameter. From the iterative calculations to decrease the errors between the average dimension parameter values of each &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; and the dimension parameter values of the subjects, the average dimension parameter values that give less than the error criterion were determined to be the representative dimension parameter values for designing knee joint implants for Korean patients. </P>","Kwak, Dai Soon;Tao, Quang Bang;Todo, Mitsugu;Jeon, Insu;",2,1,pp.368-376,https://doi.org/10.1177/0954411912442025,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART73608690,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART73608690&type=mobile,,,Korean knee joint

However, there are still some controversies in the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL. The purpose of this study was to investigate anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL using Korean cadaveric knee joints. We investigated the effect of ALL injury on its footprint distances under various knee conditions and assessed three-dimensional functional stability tests (pivot-shift and Lachmann tests) using a noninvasive triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Materials and Methods&amp;#xD; 20 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were dissected by a single surgeon. The locations of the tibial and femoral footprints of the ALL were recorded with respect to the lateral femoral epicondyle, tip of the fibular head, and Gerdy’s tubercle. The distance between the footprints were recorded in a normal knee condition. All cadavers were tested in neutral, internal, and external rotation at 30°, 60°, 90° of knee flexion. The pivot shift and Lachmann tests were measured using a triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA). Serial sectioning of the ALL and the ACL was performed after testing in normal knee joints. Measurements were collected before and after each sectioning.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Results&amp;#xD; Anatomical features of the current study were similar to those of previous cadaveric studies. The prevalence of the ALL in our study was 100%. Average distance of the tibial footprint to the tip of the fibular head was 19.85 ± 3.41 mm and to Gerdy’s tubercle was 18.3 ± 4.19mm. Average distance of the femoral footprint to the lateral femoral epicondyle was 10.25 ± 2.97mm. The footprint distance of the ALL was the longest at 30° of knee flexion (47.83 ± 8.05 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001) in a normal knee neutral rotation condition. An internal rotational force produced statistically significant increases in footprint distances in normal knees at all three knee flexion angles. During internal rotation, the footprint distance was also the longest at 30° of knee flexion (50.05 ± 8.88 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although an internal rotational force did not produce a statistically significant increase in the footprint distance after ALL transection, it increased the footprint distance at all three knee flexion angles after a combined ACL and ALL transection (p = 0.022). After a combined ACL and ALL transection, the footprint distance was the longest at 30° of knee flexion under internal rotational force (52.05 ± 7.60 mm). Pivot shift and Lachmann tests measured by the KiRA device did not show statistically significant differences between normal and ALL-transected knees. However, there were significant differences in the combined ACL-ALL-transected knees compared with normal and ALL-transected knees (p&amp;lt;0.001).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Conclusion&amp;#xD; The ALL was identified as a distinct ligament structure in this Korean cadaveric study. Considering the footprint distances of the ALL in various knee conditions, the ALL is thought to play a protective role in internal rotational stability especially at 30° of knee flexion. Isolated ALL transection did not show significant effects on the ALL footprint distances and functional stability tests. The ALL is thought to act as a secondary supportive stabilizer for rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the ACL.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Keywords: knee joint, anterolateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament, rotatory instability, KiRA, anterolateral ligament reconstruction, Korean cadaver&amp;#xD;",서대근,0,0,"iv, 33장",,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0016389705,,Anterior cruciate ligament Anterolateral ligament Rotatory instability Anterolateral ligament reconstruction Korean cadaver Knee joint;,국내박사,Korean knee joint

Knees of ≥KL grade 2 were classified as radiologic OA. The severity of joint space narrowing (JSN) was classified by X-rays as normal, mild-to-moderate, and severe JSN in radiologic OA. The subjects were grouped as normal SMI (SMI of ≥–1 standard deviation [SD] of the mean), low SMI class I (SMI of ≥–2 SDs and <–1 SD), and low SMI class II (SMI of <–2 SDs). Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥27.5 kg/m2.Results: The modified KL grade and JSN severity were negatively correlated with the SMI and positively correlated with BMI and age. The SMI was negatively correlated with age. JSN severity was significantly associated with a low SMI class compared to a normal SMI, which was more prominent in low SMI class II than class I. Obesity was significantly associated with more severe JSN, only for obesity with a low SMI class. Furthermore, patients with a low SMI class, regardless of obesity, were prone to having more severe JSN.Conclusion: This study suggested that a low SMI class was associated with aging and that an age-related low SMI was more critically related to the severity of JSN in OA.",김현제;Young Hoon Hong;,0,0,pp.285-293,http://dx.doi.org/10.12701/jyms.2021.01536,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002891276,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002891276&type=mobile,,,Korean knee joint

Methods : This is an observational study. 65 patients admitted to Daejeon Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine with musculoskeletal disorders were observed from July, 2014 to July, 2015. They were analyzed according to sex, age, pain lesion, body mass index(BMI) and treatment efficacy. All patients received a combination of treatments during hospitalization, including acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, herbal medicines and physical therapy. A zero to ten numerating rating scale (NRS) assessing pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index(WOMAC) index and Range of Motion(ROM) was used before and after treatments. Statistical correlations among assessment measurements were evaluated by examining the paired t-test and the Pearson's correlation coefficients. Results : The average BMI of all patients was <TEX>$24.03{\pm}2.95kg/m^2$</TEX>. According to clinical definition of obesity by Korean Society for the Study of Obesity, 33.8% of all patients was within normal weight, 1.5% was underweight, 33.8% was overweight, 24.6% was obesity and 6.2% was morbid obesity. For knee pain patients, NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) decreased from <TEX>$6.28{\pm}1.63$</TEX> to <TEX>$3.94{\pm}2.03$</TEX>(p<0.001).

Both the PTG and AREG showed significant increases in 30° away and 60° toward isometric strength after treatment. In addition, significant differences were observed in these strength tests between the two groups. Both groups also showed significant increases in thigh circumference, Lysholm score, and active balance agility after treatment, but no significant differences were observed between the two groups.

Although CT is attracting attention due to its reasonable price, short scan time, and excellent diagnostic ability, there are severe drawbacks of conventional CT contrast agents, such as low sensitivity, serious toxicity, and complicated synthesis process. Herein, we describe iodine-doped carbon dots (IDC) for enhancing the abilities of CT contrast agents. Method: IDC was synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis for 4 h at 180 ᕑ and analysis of its structure and size distribution with UV–Vis, XPS, FT-IR, NMR, TEM, and DLS. Furthermore, the CT values of IDC were calculated and compared with those of conventional CT contrast agents (Iohexol), and the in vitro and in vivo toxicities of IDC were determined to prove their safety. Results: IDC showed improved CT contrast enhancement compared to iohexol. The biocompatibility of the IDC was verified via cytotoxicity tests, hemolysis assays, chemical analysis, and histological analysis. The osmotic pressure of IDC was lower than that of iohexol, resulting in no dilution-induced contrast decrease in plasma. Conclusion: Based on these results, the remarkable CT contrast enhancement and biocompatibility of IDC can be used as an effective CT contrast agent for the diagnosis of various diseases compared with conventional CT contrast agents.",Yohan Jeong;진민영;김경섭;나건;,0,0,pp.503-512,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40824-022-00277-3,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002877613,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002877613&type=mobile,,,CT imaging

However, this technique is limited to anatomical assessment, thus non-invasive techniques for functional assessment of the heart are necessary. CT myocardial perfusion is a new CT based technique that provides functional assessment of the myocardium and allows for a comprehensive assessment of coronary artery disease with a single modality when combined with CTA.

Several implant and surgical factors have been implicated in contributing to the development of wear, such as type of bearing surface used, inaccurate articular geometry, and poor knee kinematics. In addition, patient-related factors, such as younger age and higher activity levels, may also contribute to wear. Our purpose was to evaluate and compare the effect of these variables on wear rates following knee arthroplasty. Recently, technological advancements have been aimed at reducing the incidence of wear by improving the PE manufacturing process, creating implants that minimize contact stresses, and refining our surgical techniques. Furthermore, the development of newer highly cross-linked PEs (HXLPEs) and the introduction of additives, such as vitamin E, to the PEs may improve overall implant survivorship. As a result, with the advent of newer implant and PE designs, wear is no longer the most common cause of early failure, though it remains an important factor in limiting long-term implant survivorship. However, there are a few clinical studies evaluating the long-term outcomes of newer HXLPEs and implant designs, with further evaluations necessary to determine the best implant&ndash;PE combination for improved knee arthroplasty survivorship.</P>","Chakravarty, Rajit;Elmallah, Randa D.

Supracondylar periprosthetic fractures frequently occur above a well-fixed prosthesis, and risk factors include anterior femoral cortical notching and use of the rotational constrained implant. Periprosthetic tibial fractures are frequently associated with loose components and malalignment or malposition of implants. Fractures of the patella are much less common and associated with rheumatoid arthritis, use of steroid, osteonecrosis and malalignment of implants. Most patients with periprosthetic fractures around the knee are the elderly with poor bone quality. There are many difficulties and increased risk of nonunion after treatment because reduction and internal fixation is interfered with by preexisting prosthesis and bone cement. Additionally, previous soft tissue injury is another disadvantageous condition for bone healing. Many authors reported good clinical outcomes after non-operative treatment of undisplaced or minimally displaced periprosthetic fractures; however, open reduction or revision arthroplasty was required in displaced fractures or fractures with unstable prosthesis. Periprosthetic fractures around the knee should be prevented by appropriate technique during total knee arthroplasty. Nevertheless, if a periprosthetic fracture occurs, an appropriate treatment method should be selected considering the stability of the prosthesis, displacement of fracture and bone quality.",Jae Doo Yoo;Nam Ki Kim;,0,0,pp.1-9,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001964911,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001964911&type=mobile,,,knee arthroplasty

However, the measurement accuracy is jointly influenced by the robot kinematics, camera-to-robot installation, and 3D camera measurement errors. Incomplete calibration of these errors can result in inaccurate measurements. This paper proposes a joint calibration method considering these three error types to achieve overall calibration. In this method, error models of the robot kinematics and camera-to-robot installation are formulated using Lie algebra. Then, a pillow error model is proposed for the 3D camera based on its error distribution and measurement principle. These error models are combined to construct a joint model based on homogeneous transformation. Finally, the calibration problem is transformed into a stepwise optimization problem that minimizes the sum of the relative position error between the calibrator and robot, and analytical solutions for the calibration parameters are derived. Simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the joint calibration method effectively improves the measurement accuracy, reducing the mean positioning error from over 2.5228 mm to 0.2629 mm and the mean distance error from over 0.1488 mm to 0.1232 mm.</P>","Wu, Lei;Zang, Xizhe;Ding, Guanwen;Wang, Chao;Zhang, Xuehe;Liu, Yubin;Zhao, Jie;",2,1,pp.7447,https://doi.org/10.3390/s23177447,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART126172693,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART126172693&type=mobile,joint calibration method . robot measurement system . binocular planar structured light camera .

If the rock is smooth, the edge of the shadow is straight, and if rough, the shadow is irregular. The image can be recorded on video tape, digitized by an image analyzing microcomputer, then processed to isolate the shadow edge. Parameters of roughness can then be calculated and displayed.This photoanalysis method compares favourably with the often awkward and impractical mechanical and optical techniques of roughness measurement. In a series of laboratory and field experiments, the authors have investigated errors resulting from variations of illumination and image processing. Results demonstrate that with reasonable precautions, the results can be reproduced to within about 5% of the full roughness range.Roughness parameters convey in a quantitative manner the meaning of ''smooth'' and ''rough'', and are needed as a basis for prediction of shear strength and other properties. The many available alternative parameters, borrowed from fields of electronics, acoustics and mechanical engineering, range from simple measures of amplitude, wavelength and slope, to more complex stochastic, frequency domain and fractal analyses. These are reviewed, and criteria for selection discussed.Shear strength models based on roughness include those of Patton, Ladanyi and Archambault, and Barton. Barton's JRC is not a geometric property: it must be estimated either from shear tests or by comparing a rough joint with the published standard set of comparator profiles. Visual comparison is found to be unreliable. Better results can be obtained by digitizing the standard profiles using the method described in this paper, and relating JRC to a measurable quantity, the roughness profile index, R<SUB>p</SUB>.

Unlike most robotic devices, the human body lacks even surfaces and right angles.

After a review of available methods that may cope with this challenge, we present a set of new methods for: (1) joint axis and position identification; and (2) flexion/extension joint angle measurement. In particular, we propose methods that use only gyroscopes and accelerometers and, therefore, do not rely on a homogeneous magnetic field. We provide results from gait trials of a transfemoral amputee in which we compare the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods to an optical 3D motion capture system. Unlike most authors, we place the optical markers on anatomical landmarks instead of attaching them to the IMUs. Root mean square errors of the knee flexion/extension angles are found to be less than 1° on the prosthesis and about 3° on the human leg. For the plantar/dorsiflexion of the ankle, both deviations are about 1°.</P>","Seel, Thomas;Raisch, Jorg;Schauer, Thomas;",2,1,pp.6891-6909,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s140406891,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART73932359,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART73932359&type=mobile,inertial measurement units . gait analysis . gyroscopes and accelerometers . avoid magnetometers . exploit kinematic constraints . sensor-to-segment mounting . joint axis and position identification . joint angle measurement . validation against optical gait analysis . validation on prosthetic and human leg,,joint measurement

Methods: Subjects were thirty-one healthy males and females (sixty-two ankles) living in Korea. Three raters with different clinical experiences measured inversion and eversion range of motion of the subtalar joint two times. Measurements were done with subjects prone (open kinetic chain) and standing (closed kinetic chain). Rater and measurement methods were based on analyzing differences in range of motion. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to determine intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. Results: Mean subtalar jont range of motion for inversion ranged from <TEX>$9.31^{\circ}$</TEX> to <TEX>$11.94^{\circ}$</TEX> for eversion, it ranged from <TEX>$6.73^{\circ}$</TEX> to <TEX>$9.20^{\circ}$</TEX>. The differences in ROM between raters and between measurement methods were significant (p<0.01). The ICCs for interrater reliability ranged from <TEX>$0.02^{\circ}$</TEX> to <TEX>$0.20^{\circ}$</TEX> for inversion and from <TEX>$0.23^{\circ}$</TEX> to <TEX>$0.39^{\circ}$</TEX> for eversion. Intrarater reliability ranged from <TEX>$0.32^{\circ}$</TEX> to <TEX>$0.78^{\circ}$</TEX> for inversion and from <TEX>$0.45^{\circ}$</TEX> to <TEX>$0.73^{\circ}$</TEX> for eversion. Conclusion: Subtalar joint inversion and eversion ROM show differences for measurement methods low reliability between different raters, and low to high intra-rater reliability within sessions.",김기원;홍완성;,2,1,pp.57-64,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIFullTextView?cn=JAKO201031559286671&dbt=JAKO&keyValue=05787966,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201031559286671,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201031559286671&type=mobile,Subtalar joint .

A triaxial electrogoniometer instrumented by three miniature precision potentiometers was developed to fulfill this task. A special linkage was used to attach this apparatus externally to the joint. Three-dimensional angular motion following the classical Eulerian angle definition was measured in real time. The error due to exoskeletal attachment was corrected by the method of 4 multiplied by 4 matrix. This technique is now being routinely used for objective functional evaluation on the patients with abnormal hip, knee and ankle joints as well as lower extremity amputees fitted with artificial limbs.","Chao, Edmund Y.
