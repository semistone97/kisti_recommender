This project is a homage to Ed Ruscha's 'Every Building on the Sunset Strip' (1966), and investigates the collection, a technique borrowed from art practice, as an architectural design method. The work is positioned in the research areas of 'the everyday', 'bottom-up urbanism', and more importantly in the emerging research into the impact that (light) industry has on the economic and social sustainability of our cities. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The work is a survey of the threatened buildings and the associated job and trade losses in LuZhou. At minimum, it will be a significant archive of Taipei's industrial past, if and when the warehouses are demolished. It puts factories into the mainstream urban design debate. In the installation, the A5 survey documents highlight and personalise the individual jobs and industry that will be lost. From a distance, the wall of images depicts the scale of the imminent destruction. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: This work was the result of a research fellowship at Tamkang University. It was seen by 500+ visitors in this government-sponsored design gallery: industry, academic and government representatives (including the Director of Taipei City Planning). URS 127 Design Gallery is a public space managed by Tamkang University's Department of Architecture; URS stands for Urban Regeneration Station.

Kerstin Thompson Architecture (KTA) showed five works - Carrum Downs Police Station, MUMA Gallery, Lake Conneware House, Napier Street Housing and Royal Botanic Gardens Visitor Centre - as one of ten architectural firms (5 from Melbourne, 5 from Seoul) selected to exhibit. The exhibited work included large scale photographs, working drawings and exegetical text. CONTRIBUTION: The exhibition explored architectural approaches that worked 'within the city rather than upon it', architecture that 'intervenes and inserts, rather than overlays or eradicates'. Within this context, the public projects exhibited by KTA explore relationships between interior and exterior, building and street, and the existing and the new. This draws on Thompson's ongoing practice and design research focussing on architecture as a civic endeavour, forging connections between buildings, their surroundings and the people who inhabit them. SIGNIFICANCE: 'Architectural Urbanism' was an international, cross institutional exhibition that received external funding, evidencing significance for the selected works by the 10 participating practices. In Seoul, the exhibition was opened by the deputy Australian Ambassador. The Melbourne exhibition was reviewed in Architecture Australia (AA). These KTA projects have also received multiple awards and media attention including four AIA (Australian Institute of Architects) Victorian Architecture Awards, an IDEA (Interior Design Excellence Awards) award, three book features, critical reviews in AA, and articles in SMH, The Australian, Broadsheet and Archdaily.",,,,,,ARDC,"{coordinates:[0.0,0.0],type:point}",https://doi.org/10.25439/rmt.27353883.v1,,,https://doi.org/10.25439/rmt.27353883.v1,,2025-04-21 12:02:59,2024-10-30,0001-01-01 00:00:00,['Not Assigned'],['none'],['none'],['none'],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],Architectural Urbanism

The project was conceived to be cumulative and comparative as it travelled to three Asian cities; local images were added in Beijing to those collected in previous exhibitions in Seoul and Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: This work builds upon research in bottom-up or micro-urbanism strategies in the Asian city. It develops observational and participatory techniques to enable the general public to engage with urban design issues by contributing to the exhibition with text and images. This work marks a significant shift within Asia. Instead of looking to the West for solutions to contemporary urban design issues, this research proposes that Asia is now providing more appropriate models to deal with the complexity that is facing both eastern and western cities. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project received funding support from VESKI (Victorian State Government: $20,000 for four exhibitions). It was exhibited by invitation in CU Space Gallery, the first architecture gallery in China in the prestigious 798 Art Zone.

Organised by Storefront for Art and Architecture in New York, the competition called for the design of an architectural competition. Future Factory won an Honourable Mention and was exhibited, along with the other 17 finalists, at Storefront as part of the 'Letters to the Mayor' exhibition, a group exhibition presenting letters written by 50 international architects to the political leaders of ten cities around the world. Wilkins' project team included Ian Nazareth (practicing architect and researcher) and five RMIT Architecture students. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Future Factory calls for architectural ideas about the future of manufacturing, factory spaces and their connection to the city. The competition proposal asserts that contemporary manufacturing thrives on urbanism, and that this presents opportunities to redefine our spatial, social and programmatic connections between production, consumption and everyday life. The overall exhibition, which Future Factory was a part of, was a compilation of briefs, facts, claims, desires and dreams for the construction of our cities, their future foundations and horizons. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: Storefront for Art and Architecture is a landmark international contemporary gallery in New York operating as a critical platform for the promotion and curation of radical investigations into architecture and art. With the intention to provoke long-standing conventions of the architecture competition, the Competition of Competitions attracted more than 100 entries, which were reviewed by a jury of professionals and visionaries including Amale Andraos (Architect, Work AC), Paola Anotonelli (Architecture Curator, MoMA), and Michael Sorkin (Architect and architecture critic).

The exhibited cells were selected items from a range of geometric and material mock-ups and tests, used to identify suitable options for production and to understand those that enabled significant design impact. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION This project is a rare example of architectural design research that draws on: 1) architectural design research into strategies for designing around performance criteria in early stage design through the integration of digital simulation; (2) architectural research into the potential of digital fabrication technologies to contribute significant advantages in prototyping and testing of design ideas within architectural design processes; and (3) acoustic research that recognises the emergence of acoustic diffusion as a contributor to acoustic comfort.

Heritage restrictions forced a careful consideration of the rear façade and its appearance from the street. In response, Iredale Pedersen Hook (IPH) slipped the large-scale addition under the steep pitch of the roof of the host building, creating a dialogue between the old hip roof form and the required volume of the addition. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The extension creates a family home with two faces: the demure, front façade and the dynamic rear elevation clad in copper. The expansive extension rises, stealthily, from beneath the terracotta tiles of the original roof and it shifts and distorts beneath the existing structure. The front rooms of the house were restored and a continuity between the two spaces was achieved by the use of marble, waxed recycled timber, copper and bluestone against a neutral colour palette. The project also continues the studio's investigation of the collective upgrading of environmental performance of existing suburbs through the incremental changes made to existing building stock. Here substantial insulation, a large solar array, massive water tank installed in parallel with the swimming pool and an integrated approach to all services sits alongside less technological 'green' innovations such as recycled timber, water-saving fixtures and natural wax finishes.

The 4 selected works by B+W exemplify this approach, by sharing common ground which transcends their formal differences because of how they play with the threshold and boundaries of urban site conditions as a means to reinterpret the ordinary. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The Court House was the only one of these 4 works not previously published. The selection of these projects as examples of 'architectural urbanism' inserts this body of work into broader intercultural conversation.

Its purpose was to reconnect a severed historical rail and horse trail, and to mark a civic presence along that highway as an entry to metropolitan Melbourne. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION This design for a bridge asks two questions; first: how can objects of infrastructure be integrated into their physical environment? Second: how can that object activate an interior akin to architectural space? The design unites research fields of architectural design, landscape architecture, urbanism, and engineering. Works of this type often suffer from their hybridity. In contrast, this design brings a consideration of architectural space to a program that is often treated like a road. The project's enveloping mesh skin aimed to capture a relationship with the trees and topography of its surrounding, while also providing a degree of enclosure that could encourage inhabitation. It reconciles the pragmatic infrastructure with a sculptural response to landscape. In turn, this aims to contribute a built civic presence to the environment.

Speculative design competitions, are an important platform to engage with the discourse and practice of architecture, where ideas and positions are contested. It facilitates an advanced level of experimentation and venturous practice, that supports other poles of material, spatial and socio-cultural research. The Center for Public Interest Design (CPID) is a research and action centre at Portland State University that aims to investigate, promote, and engage in inclusive design practices that address the growing needs of underserved communities worldwid¬¬e. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: 'reGENERATION' was an ideas competition intended to facilitate a dialogue on the subject of intergenerational housing. Rather than consider multi-generational housing as an isolated entity, the entry 'Into the Void' considered the provision of housing as an opportunity to explore a new typology of urban development, one that actively learns from and engages with the contemporary city and its pluralistic architecture and urbanism. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project was a winning entry and awarded third place by an international panel of experts including Tim Carpenter, Teddy Cruz, Margarette Leite, Dan Pitera, Belinda Tato, and Jose Vallejo. The research places itself in a discourse of ageing population, that is set to a global challenge for cities. This no longer solely limited to demographics but central to the wider debate around social inclusion, employment, economics, education and health. In prototyping urban form, articulating a clear architectural position through testing social interactions and demographic interplays at multiple resolutions and scales, the research aims to address a more inclusive strategy for ageing in place.

Generative tracing is understood as an erosive operation that effectively creates a new network of urban pathways and waterfront settlements. Architectural form is organised around this network, with the programmatic requirements of a new cultural precinct compressed, expanded and re-arranged to address a broader urban agenda. The project posititions urban design as being part of an extended evolutionary process in which a city is engaged. The design contributes a series of techniques for generating new versions of a city - specifically through a porous water front edge condition. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project has been published an exhibited in numerous locations. The project was first published in the book 'Idea Design: Evolving Architecture' (A&C Publishing, Seoul, Korea 2013) ISBN: 978-8972121442 along with a number of other significant international practices. In 2016 it was invited for exhibition the 'Sino-Australian Dialogue on Design Practice Research,' and published in the catalogue ISBN: 978-0-7340-5260-5.

Mobile Landscapes is a mapping of the Murray River, building upon several years of archival research of its flood histories. It comprises: a line drawing of the 2500-kilometre river system (15 A4 sheets of drafting film), and 15 photographic recordings (each A6 format) of a 24 kilometre walk undertaken (in 2001) across the '1956 floodplain'. The line drawing shows the existing river, the shoreline of a 1:100 year flood event (1956) and the survey grids of existing river towns. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The major contribution is within the scholarship of site studies in architecture, and has particular relevance as an approach to uncovering invisible site histories. This knowledge is useful in the design process as it can help the architect engage with ephemeral site phenomena as a site specific design approach. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The exhibition was curated by designer Jaewon Cho and Associate Professor Sand Helsel (RMIT). It was funded by the Arts Council in Korea, the Australia - Korea Foundation, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. This project has led to several invited public lectures: at the University of Siegen, Germany, the University of Sint-Lucas, Ghent, Belgium, and at the Affirmative Architecture Conference in Melbourne and Perth.

The exhibiton and sympoisa were supported by Australia Korea Foundation, the State Government of Victoria (via VESKI, Victorian Endowment for Science, Knowledge and Innovation) and RMIT's Design Research Institute. X-Field pays homage to Rosalind Kruas' seminal essay 'Sculpture in the Expanded Field' (1979). X-Field Archive, which featured expanded versions of earlier work, was curated by Richard Black and Sand Helsel. This research statement refers to Black's work in the show: a section and model are two key 'tools + techniques' used to by Times two Architects (TTA) to knit a new work into its existing context. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Models and section drawings from two separate architectural works were exhibited to demonstrate how they are useful tools to negotiate specific site conditions and address the curatorial themes of the exhibition. Two models of a new work showed a range of relationships between its site, form and material. Section drawings and a photograph revealed how the sectional profile of an addition mirrored and transformed the profile of the existing house within the new work allowing TTA to successfully negotiate strict heritage guidelines. The section and model make a contribution to a site responsive design process. Both pieces are a critical reflection of the design process of Black's architectural practice. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: X-Field Archive was the culminating show of a four-year international project supported by RMIT and external partners, including state and federal governments.

Geoscience Australia developed a start-to-end open-source methodology ranging from data acquisition, interpretation and storage to data modelling, to create a national seamless chronostratigraphic framework and predict depth and spatial extent of potential resources. Central to Geoscience Australia’s subsurface modelling workflow, the Estimates of Geological and Geophysical Surfaces (EGGS) database was designed to help address data variability found in large datasets compilation (Mathews et al., 2020). The EGGS database stores depth estimates consistently compiled and standardised from various sources. Depth estimates in EGGS comply with a set of standards and provide an internally consistent and format agnostic baseline suitable to generate models using various digital applications. For example, each depth estimate is labelled as ‘BASE’ if they characterise the base of a geological era, or ‘WITHIN”, if the depth measurement characterises a stratigraphic unit within a geological era. The depth of a geological interface is also characterised by the overlying and underlying stratigraphic units, where the stratigraphic information adheres to the Australian Stratigraphic Units Database (ASUD; Geoscience Australia and Australian Stratigraphy Commission, 2024). This open-source workflow provides the ability to tailor the layered cover model to any subsurface mapping requirements, such as understanding geological sequences to guide exploration strategies under cover, assess resources potential and their economic viability, mapping groundwater resources and support competing land-use management.;<div>Geoscience Australia’s Exploring for the Future program provides precompetitive information to inform decision-making by government, community and industry on the sustainable development of Australia's mineral, energy and groundwater resources. By gathering, analysing and interpreting new and existing precompetitive geoscience data and knowledge, we are building a national picture of Australia’s geology and resource potential. This leads to a strong economy, resilient society and sustainable environment for the benefit of all Australians. This includes supporting Australia’s transition to net zero emissions, strong, sustainable resources and agriculture sectors, and economic opportunities and social benefits for Australia’s regional and remote communities. The Exploring for the Future program, which commenced in 2016, is an eight year, $225m investment by the Australian Government. This work contributes to building a better understanding of the Australian continent, whilst giving the Australian public the tools they need to help them make informed decisions in their areas of interest. </div><div>To enable a sustainable and responsible use of the Earth's subsurface environment,<strong> </strong>a quantified knowledge of the geological composition and structure of the subsurface is an economic imperative to inform decision-making.

This system is designed to seamlessly integrate advanced technology, robust ethical frameworks, and extensive citizen participation, aiming to create a more responsive, adaptable, and principled form of democracy. The research delves into the complex and multi-layered structure of Nebulocracy, which is intended to address the intricacies of modern governance while adhering to core ethical principles. At the heart of Nebulocracy lie five core principles that guide its entire structure and operation. The first principle is Ethical Objectivism, which posits that there are universal ethical truths that can be discovered and applied to governance. This principle serves as the foundation of the system's moral framework, ensuring that decisions are grounded in objective ethical standards. The second principle, Value Integration, recognizes the importance of incorporating the diverse subjective values of citizens into the governance process. This ensures that the system remains responsive to the evolving needs and beliefs of the population, balancing universal ethical principles with individual and cultural perspectives. The third principle, Adaptive Governance, acknowledges the rapidly changing nature of the world and designs the system to evolve and adapt to new challenges, technological advancements, and societal needs. This adaptability ensures that Nebulocracy remains relevant and effective over time. The fourth principle, Citizen Participation, emphasizes the importance of direct and continuous citizen involvement in the governance process. Unlike traditional representative democracies, where citizen involvement is often limited to periodic voting, Nebulocracy provides multiple channels for citizens to engage in decision-making processes, contribute their ideas, and shape the direction of governance. The fifth principle, Specialized Governance, recognizes that effective governance in a complex world requires specialized knowledge and expertise. Therefore, Nebulocracy divides governance into distinct branches, each focused on specific domains, to ensure that decisions are made with a deep understanding of relevant issues. The Axiological Framework is a crucial component of Nebulocracy, serving as the supreme governing body that ensures all governmental actions align with ethical principles and societal values. This framework consists of several interrelated elements, including the Moral Graph, Value Cards, the Ethical Values Integration System (EVIS), and the Axiological Oversight Council (AOC). The Moral Graph is a dynamic, multidimensional representation of the ethical landscape of society, visually mapping out how different values interact, their relative importance, and their application in various contexts. This graph is continuously updated based on new ethical insights, empirical data, and citizen input, ensuring that it remains current and representative. Value Cards are detailed articulations of specific values, principles, or ethical considerations that citizens, experts, and AI systems can propose. These cards are then evaluated and potentially integrated into the Moral Graph, allowing for a granular and nuanced understanding of ethical concepts. The Ethical Values Integration System (EVIS) is an advanced AI system that manages the Moral Graph and Value Cards, using sophisticated algorithms to process ethical data, update the Moral Graph, and provide real-time ethical analysis for decision-making processes across all branches of government. The Axiological Oversight Council (AOC) is an independent body of ethicists, philosophers, scientists, and cultural representatives that oversees the operation of EVIS and the overall ethical integrity of the government. This council reviews and validates new Value Cards, audits the Moral Graph for consistency and accuracy, and provides guidance on complex ethical issues. Additionally, the Peoples, Wants, Desires, Interests Sovereign Council (PWDISC) focuses on understanding and representing the diverse needs, aspirations, and interests of the citizenry, serving as a bridge between the ethical framework and the lived experiences of people. The Sovereign People's Health and Safety Council is dedicated to ensuring the physical and mental well-being of citizens, integrating health and safety considerations into all aspects of governance. The People's Enquiry Inquisition Branch On Needs Wants Desires Interests Agency serves as a direct channel for citizens to express their needs, wants, desires, and interests, conducting regular surveys, holding public forums, and using AI-assisted analysis to understand and articulate the will of the people. The General Government Advisors Agency Council brings together advisors from various fields to provide comprehensive guidance to all branches of government, ensuring that decisions are informed by a wide range of expertise. Nebulocracy's governmental structure is highly specialized and multi-tiered, designed to address the complex challenges of modern governance. It consists of several layers, each with specific functions and responsibilities. The Primary Tertiary Governmental Structure is composed of the Seven Omni Branches, each focused on a specific aspect of societal management. These branches include the Omni-Potent Branch, responsible for matters of national security, resource management, and emergency response; the Omni-Present Branch, focused on government accessibility and communication; the Omni-Amor Fati Branch, dedicated to fostering resilience, adaptability, and positive engagement with life's challenges; the Omni-Science Branch, overseeing scientific research, technological development, and evidence-based policymaking; the Omni-Beneficial Branch, focused on social welfare, infrastructure development, and environmental sustainability; the Omni-Benevolent Branch, dedicated to ethical governance, human rights protection, and the promotion of social justice; and the Omni-Kantian Branch, emphasizing rationality, moral duty, and respect for individual autonomy. Each of these branches has its own sub-parliament, allowing for specialized legislative processes within their respective domains, and operates as supraregional organizational superorganisms, coordinating activities across different regions and levels of government. The Secondary Governmental Structure includes the OmniCooperation Constitutional Cern People's United Clarity Parliament (OCCCPUCPCQ), also known as the Clarity Parliament, which serves as the central legislative organ, integrating inputs from all Omni Branches and ensuring that legislation aligns with the ethical framework and constitutional principles. The Omnipresent Central Government (OCCGPUC) is the central executive body, responsible for implementing policies and coordinating activities across all branches and regions. The 7 Prime Ministers Swarm Hive Mind Lead Cabinet is a unique leadership structure consisting of seven prime ministers, each aligned with one of the Omni Branches, working collaboratively as a swarm hive mind to provide overall direction and coordination for the government. The General Primary Governmental Structure includes foundational elements such as the Supreme Constitution, the highest law of the land, enshrining fundamental rights, principles, and the structure of government; the Supreme Constitutional Institution, responsible for interpreting and upholding the Constitution; the Presidential Constitutional Council (PCC), tasked with enforcing the Constitution and serving as its guardians; the Supreme Government Body Of Human Safety And All Human Flourishing And Thriving Institute (SGBHSAHFTI), focused on comprehensive human well-being and integrating considerations of safety, health, and overall flourishing into all aspects of governance; and the Supreme Constitutional Anti-Corruption Court, a specialized judiciary focused on preventing and prosecuting corruption within the government. The Hive Mind Superintelligence Individualistic Cooperative Swarms Collective Omni-United (HMSICSCOU) is an advanced AI system that supports decision-making across all branches of government, integrating diverse perspectives and vast amounts of data to generate optimal solutions. The Specialized Primary Governmental Structure includes a variety of specialized bodies and institutions that focus on specific aspects of governance, such as the Supreme All Knowing Overwatch Observatory, a high-level monitoring system providing comprehensive oversight of all government activities; the Supreme Freedom of Press Sovereign, ensuring and protecting freedom of the press and media independence; the Supreme Constitutional Human Rights Court, a specialized court dedicated to protecting and enforcing human rights; the Supreme Open Science and Logic Sovereign Council, promoting open scientific inquiry and logical reasoning in governance; and the Supreme Constitutional Dating Compatibility and All Personality Analysis Sovereign Science Council, applying scientific methods to understand personality dynamics and social compatibility, informing policies related to social harmony and personal development. Nebulocracy places a strong emphasis on active citizen involvement in governance through various mechanisms. The Citizen Engagement Platform (CEP) is a comprehensive digital platform that allows citizens to participate in debates, vote on policies, and contribute ideas to the governance process. AI-Assisted Voting Hubs are facilities that use advanced AI to provide citizens with comprehensive, unbiased information about voting issues, helping them make informed decisions. Citizen Moral Assemblies are randomly selected groups of citizens who deliberate on ethical issues and contribute to the development of the Moral Graph. Public Audits and Citizen Juries are regular audits and juries composed of citizens to evaluate government performance and ensure accountability. Participatory Budgeting processes allow citizens to directly allocate a portion of public budgets to projects they deem important. Town Hall Meetings are regular forums for direct interaction between citizens and government officials, providing opportunities for citizens to voice their concerns and engage in dialogue with decision-makers. Nebulocracy's economic model is designed to align with its ethical principles and promote universal well-being. The Eubioic Currency (EUB) is a digital, decentralized currency managed to promote ethical economic activities and overall societal well-being. Cybernetic Resource-Based Economics is an advanced economic planning system that uses real-time data and AI analysis to optimize resource allocation based on actual needs and ethical considerations. Catallaxy Blockchain Economics is a system that facilitates spontaneous market order through blockchain technology, allowing for more efficient and ethical economic interactions. Universal High Income (UHI) is an advanced form of universal basic income that aims to provide all citizens with resources for a high quality of life. Skill Validation Blockchains are a system for verifying and recording individual skills and competencies, promoting a meritocratic approach to employment and education. Nebulocracy leverages advanced technologies to enhance governance. AI-Driven Moral Graph Updates involve continuous analysis and integration of ethical data to keep the Moral Graph current and representative. A Blockchain-Based Governance Ledger is a secure, transparent record of all government actions and decisions. Neural-Symbolic AI Systems are advanced AI that combines symbolic reasoning with neural networks to assist in complex decision-making processes. A Computing Cloud Network is a distributed computing infrastructure that supports all governmental operations and citizen participation platforms. Augmented and Virtual Reality Interfaces are immersive technologies used to enhance citizen engagement and understanding of complex governance issues. While Nebulocracy heavily relies on advanced technology, it also incorporates mechanisms to function effectively offline. Physical Moral Graph Representations are tangible, interactive models of the Moral Graph displayed in public spaces for citizen engagement. Value Card Libraries are physical repositories of Value Cards accessible in community centers and government buildings. Offline Citizen Assemblies are regular in-person gatherings for citizens to discuss issues, vote, and contribute to governance processes. Paper-Based Documentation Systems are comprehensive paper records of all government actions, decisions, and citizen inputs as a backup to digital systems. Manual Decision-Making Protocols are established procedures for government branches to operate and make decisions without AI assistance when necessary. When compared to the governance systems of Finland, the USA, and China, Nebulocracy offers several unique features and potential advantages. Finland is known for its highly functional democracy, strong social welfare system, and high levels of citizen trust in government. Nebulocracy shares some similarities with the Finnish system in its emphasis on social welfare and citizen participation but goes further in its use of advanced technology for governance and its more specialized governmental structure. The United States has a federal system with separation of powers between executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Nebulocracy's Seven Omni Branches offer a more specialized and potentially more agile governance structure compared to the US system. Additionally, Nebulocracy's emphasis on direct citizen participation and ethical governance represents a significant departure from the primarily representative democracy of the US. China's governance system is characterized by a strong central government and a single ruling party. While China has been incorporating more technology into its governance, Nebulocracy's approach is fundamentally different in its emphasis on ethical objectivism, citizen participation, and decentralized decision-making. Nebulocracy aims to combine the efficiency often associated with centralized systems like China's with the freedoms and participation levels of Western democracies. Potential benefits of Nebulocracy include enhanced ethical governance through the comprehensive Axiological Framework, increased citizen engagement and more direct democracy, more specialized and potentially more effective governance through the Seven Omni Branches, greater adaptability to changing circumstances and emerging challenges, and potential for more evidence-based and rational decision-making through the integration of AI and scientific principles. However, implementing such a system would also face significant challenges. The complexity of the system could be difficult for citizens to fully understand and navigate. Heavy reliance on technology could pose risks in case of system failures or cyber attacks. Ensuring the ethical AI systems are truly unbiased and aligned with human values would be a monumental task. The transition from existing governance systems to Nebulocracy would likely be complex and face significant resistance. Balancing the universal ethical principles with diverse cultural values and individual freedoms could prove challenging. In conclusion, Nebulocracy represents a bold reimagining of democratic governance for the 21st century and beyond. By integrating advanced technologies, ethical frameworks, and extensive citizen participation, it aims to create a system that is more responsive, principled, and effective than traditional forms of government. While implementing such a complex system would undoubtedly face significant challenges, the core principles and mechanisms of Nebulocracy offer valuable insights for improving existing governance structures. The Supreme Constitutional Individualistic-Cooperative Collective Swarms Hive Minds Network Institution (SCICCSHMNI) and the Hive Mind Superintelligence Individualistic Cooperative Swarms Collective Omni-United (HMSICSCOU) are two key components of Nebulocracy that embody its commitment to leveraging collective intelligence and advanced technology for ethical and effective governance. Together, these institutions form a comprehensive governance approach that spans from day-to-day administration to long-term existential considerations, embodying Nebulocracy's vision of a highly advanced, ethical, and adaptive system of governance.",,,,,,HARVARD Dataverse,"{type:point,coordinates:[0.0,0.0]}",https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/LTKBSH,,,10.7910/DVN/LTKBSH,,2025-04-28 18:34:49,2024-12-13,0001-01-01 00:00:00,"['Arts and Humanities', 'Earth and Environmental Sciences', 'Engineering', 'Law', 'Social Sciences', 'Other']",['none'],['none'],['none'],[],"['Daniel Kasper (Theoretical Physicist)Hyperintelligence Researchers, The Omega Team']",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],"['Hyperintelligence Researchers, The Omega Team']",['Harvard Dataverse'],[],public architecture

It is a 1982 heritage-listed building by architect Sir Roy Grounds, with interiors by John Truscott. The building's redevelopment by ARM in 2012 repaired its performance acoustics to world standards, and installed state-of-the-art stage technology and back-of-house facilities. It is an outstanding heritage response to an important civic and heritage place of architectural, social and cultural significance. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: ARM's underlying task was to repair Hamer Hall's standing as a major civic building and make it a 21st-century venue. The building represents two artistic discourses in Melbourne: the architectural story of the castle and the mine: the theatrical story of the palace and the cave of jewels. ARM reinterpreted these narratives and added their voice to the story of Hamer Hall. According to jury citation, the sophistication of the design proposition and its execution allowed an approach which restores and celebrates the works of both Grounds and Truscott, adding a third voice that challenges and plays with its predecessors with wit and exuberance. This project exemplifies ARM's radical contribution to the dissemination of ideas and development of an acute, experimental and critical architectural culture in Melbourne and, more broadly, Australia. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: The project won multiple awards at the 2013 Australian Institute of Architects (AIA) National Awards: the Lachlan Macquarie Award - Heritage Architecture; Marion Mahony Award - Interior Design; National Commendation - Public Architecture; and National Commendation - Urban Design. At the 2013 AIA VIC Chapter Awards, it won: Public Architecture Award - Alterations & Additions; and John George Knight Award - Heritage Architecture.

The futuristic dome-like structure of building is exemplary of the radical architecture of ARM, which has received numerous significant awards. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Through this project, ARM aimed to celebrate the tradition of great libraries, create an ambitious, future-oriented building, and design an organic structure that lets the natural world penetrate the interior. The building inhabits both the past and the future. Its form pays homage to the ideals of self-improvement, knowledge and curiosity expressed in the domes of great reading rooms such as the State Library of Victoria. It also recalls an era of great civic gestures of the 19th century - a time when domes on public buildings represented democracy, enlightenment and the arrival of civil society.

The project was won by Taylor Cullity Lethlean (TCL), in collaboration with Tonkin Zulaikha Greer, through an international design competition held by the ACT Government in 2004. Perry Lethlean, as a Director of TCL, led the implementation of this project. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: The project redefines the meaning of a public garden in the 21st Century. Growing out of the very real issues of sustainability, biodiversity and public environmental concern, the National Arboretum is a strategy, a program and an ongoing event. The 100 forests not only provide a unique experience - the pleasure of being enveloped in a forest of one species - but are also seed banks for the future. As it develops into the future, the National Arboretum continues to build links across the world, an exchange of knowledge and actual plant material that works towards reversing the planet's loss of biodiversity. This project demonstrates Lethlean's contributions to contemporary design processes that connect to a site's context, its specificity and nuances, including its cultural and environmental qualities, and garden design that elicits meaning and interpretive experience for the public.

It incorporates both living and communal areas designed to increase communication and exchanges with other tenants. The building occupies an important corner in the design of the Clayton campus, and has contributed to a new sense of urban legibility for the broader University. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: To the north and east, Logan Hall has a generous colonnade which aligns with the natural pedestrian desire lines of the campus. The colonnade provides a sheltered space between the cafes and the northern landscaped forecourt. To the east, the split masses of the building reinforce the civic quality of Scenic Boulevard. To the north, the modularity of the student units has been utilized to provide an unlikely and expressive form the recalls the distinct modernist origins of the Monash Clayton Campus. Emulating the city, the building acknowledges mixed-use ground-level occupation, which includes a café and supermarket. Above these 'urban' ground levels, the residential floors follow a planning strategy for defining student community.

The square is part of the $290 million Revitalising Central Dandenong project. It opened in March 2014. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: 'Alterations', the ground pattern for the new Civic Square is a translation of topographical, clothing and locally-sourced patterns into a design that reconfigures the local ground as a giant body in motion or choreography. The name refers to the work of local tailors. The project develops and extends Paul Carter's research on how to historicise public space. Beginning with Federation Square (2002) Carter has worked on several projects in which inscriptions reveal the poetic, cultural and material aspects of sites.

The name for the centre means 'whirlwind' in the local Kariyarra language, and pays tribute to the centre's design, which architect Sophie Cleland likened to a cyclonic pattern, creating a 'shimmering, rippling effect on an otherwise flat landscape'. Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett called the Centre '... a spectacular piece of architecture that will become a landmark for Hedland'. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: ARM designed the building as a mirage; using a 'halftone' pixelated technique, the buildings entry facade acts as a clear visual image from long distances, whilst being highly agitated on closer inspection. The building looks different depending on the weather and the time of day: sometimes it blends with the sky, sometimes it stands out against the red dust. Despite the restrictions of location, climate and budget, ARM managed to create an 'iconic' building with lateral thinking and innovation. The Stadium is an important litmus test for the basic value of civic architecture and how to design for, and with, the local condition.

The hospital opened in 2014, as a twelve level quaternary facility, housing specialist acute and sub-acute services with research and teaching facilities. A State Government initiative, it forms the hub of a state-wide network of paediatric services for Queensland's population of 4.5 million. It is the biggest public children's hospital in Australia. RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: Design work began with research into the genealogy and typology of the contemporary hospital, to radically rethink both the care model and the way in which the building can contribute to the city as a civic marker and touchstone for the Brisbane community. The project is designed around the idea of a 'living tree'- a network of 'trunks and branches.' The building sits in an urban park which serves as a gathering place for the local Southbank community. According to the AIA jury, the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital transforms a large and complex piece of healthcare infrastructure into a series of framed moments which both surprise and delight.

RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION: JMD design led prominent landscape architecture, urban design and architecture firms Taylor Cullity Lethlean, Tonkin Zulaikha Greer and Gehl Architects (Denmark) to improve connectivity at the civic heart of the city. The revitalisation has improved social interaction through both programmed and impromptu activation of the space, evidenced through the reduction of crime and antisocial behaviour since the square's opening in September 2014. The design establishes an identity and character unique to the city and serves as the catalyst for the future expansion of the city within Parramatta Square. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE: JMD design led the $35 million Parramatta Square development, to transform the 10,000-square-metre space at the centre of one of the largest urban renewal projects in Australia (totalling $2 billion).

Over the past century it has been capped and canalised, its primacy in the landscape superseded by the grand axis of Anzac Parade. The proposal that JMD collaborated on invests in the ancient system and reveals it as a complementary figure to Anzac Parade. Combining enhanced public open space and water management, together these initiatives define a new and highly liveable urban structure. Anzac Parade is reconfigured as a boulevard punctuated by new civic places of intensity, whilst the revealed Millstream is reconfigured as a new green spine punctuated by a variety of water bodies within their associated parks. SIGNIFICANCE: This proposal was 1 of 4 finalists where the public was invited to provide feedback; this was a significant move to better understand the community's needs and aspirations. The independent expert jury consisted of Malcolm Snow, Ben Hewett, Jennifer Neales, Kerry Clare and Tim Greer, who unanimously chose JMD, Hill Thalis + Bennett and Trimble as the winner for its diverse range of public benefits, including identification of more public spaces and the integration of light rail, roads and pedestrian access. Randwick City Council awarded the winners $300,000 and published the proposal and consultation report on the Council website.
