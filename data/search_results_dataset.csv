Cold Front was held in conjunction with an exhibition of photographs by Frank Hurley and Herbert Ponting whose seminal images of Antarctica can be found in every public photography collection. Cold Front added knowledge of both Antarctica and the Arctic through new, contemporary renderings. Duxbury reflected on climate change and its effects, extending her earlier explorations with new media. Her three pieces addressed the Artic through a variety of media with the titles Lost (for) Words, a theme which could be interpreted in a number of ways - to represent her experience of the Arctic as 'a place that was so stunningly beautiful it left me Lost for Words'; to relate to the effects of climate change (which leave us speechless) and to the indigenous population - the Inuit of Baffin Island - with whom she stayed for 4 days, finding their language incomprehensible. The Romanised text, based on Pitman shorthand, includes few vowels but many letters used rarely in English - k, q and j. Duxbury was aware that global warming might leave them without snow, for which they have 24 words, and these words would become redundant. 'Loss of words equals loss of culture'. Duxbury had not created wax tablets previously and used a shelf with its associations, being left on a shelf, redundant, unwanted, out-of-date. She used paraffin wax, which is derived from petroleum, the very material that is causing climate change and the ice to melt. The text in, Lost (for) Words-account, is a palimpsest of historical narratives of the difficulties of penetrating the ice of the North-West Passage. The single words in each frame that have 'melted' from the surrounding voices spell out nostalgia for the ice and snow.

This research was the first project where a jeweller explored and interpreted a personal experience of Antarctica to produce jewellery objects that used photography to depict the landscape. These objects reveal new interpretations of Antarctica and explore the use of photography on hard mediums such as vitreous enamel. Research Significance This research was presented at The Museum of Art and Design, which explores the value of making across all fields of contemporary creative practice. The Museum of Art and Design is the key North American museum that publishes on jewellery and researches and develops large international jewellery exhibitions. This temporary exhibition took over four years to formulate was accompanied by a 256 page book with essays and images exploring. Research Contribution The work was selected in the first international survey of contemporary and historic jewellery to explore the use of the photograph. In the Chapter on Remembered Spaces - Imagined Spaces from the Publication: Landscape imagery lost its innocence in the twentieth century, with photography and other art forms devoting themselves to climate change, industrialization, and the pollution of the environment and providing a territory where a longing for the idyllic could be projected. throughout this transition the souvenir has remained inescapable and proven itself subversive by affirming how potent images are constructing autonomous systems of language in jewelry. In her works, Haydon follows a conceptual approach that resembles a systematic preservation of evidence. This large scale international survey exhibition and publication situate this research, which has produced representations using photography, enamel and jewellery to consider of Antarctica in new and innovative ways.

The aim of these analyses was to evaluate the consequences of landscape defragmentation, induced by deforestation and intensification of agricultural practices, on changes in biological communities.  Sample collection, storage and subsampling: Sediment core was collected using an Uwitec gravity corer equipped with a 63mm PVC liner. The core was stored at 4°C in a cold and dark room for 3 weeks prior to subsampling. The sediment core was opened and subsampled in a previously sterilized hoot (DNA cleaner and UV) in a dedicated biological room at the University of Paris-Saclay. Each sample was extracted from the sediment core using sterilized metal plates inserted on either side of the layer to be sampled (the central part of this sample was then sub-sampled to remove the part of the sediment in contact with the PVC tube of the core and the cutting tools). During this process the operators were equipped with gloves, masks and headgear to avoid any risk of contamination. A blank was placed in the fume cupboard to control contamination during core opening and sampling.  Extraction and assignation: SedDNA was retrieved using a standardized protocol that combines the use of commercial kits (Nucleospin soil – Macherey-Nagel) and the extracellular DNA pre-treatment described in Taberlet et al. (1). In order to limit amplification biases and to improve the metabarcoding sensitivity, a combination of 7 genetic markers was used to PCR-amplify each targeted taxonomic group (plants - 50-70 bp – trnL (2),  plants - 150 bp – rbcL (3), plants/fungi – 320 bp –ITS (4), plants – 380 bp – ITS , metazoa – 200 bp – 16S (5), Eukaryotes – 200 bp – 18S (6), vertebrates – 200 bp – 12S (7)). PCRs were realized in octuplicates with positive and negative controls. Extraction controls were also amplified with the dedicated primers. PCR products were cleaned using the MinElute purification kit (QIAGEN) and all purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar concentrations at the exception of the extraction and the PCR negative controls as they were not concentrated enough. Then, each sample pool was run on an Agilent Bioanalyzer using the DNA High Sensitivity LabChip kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to verify amplicon length and each sample was finally quantified with a Qubit fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Libraries were generated with a PCR-free protocol in order to tremendously reduce the number of chimeras induced by the metabarcoding approach. One microgram of each purified PCR products pool was submitted to molecular end-repair and then ligated to Illumina adapters prior to sequencing on Illumina platforms (Next-Generation Sequencing; Fasteris, Switzerland) using a NovaSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a paired-end read mode covering the amplicon lengths. The objective was to obtain approximately 1 million reads per marker and per sample. Bioinformatics analyses were performed using the OBITools (8) and QIIME2 (9) pipelines. Reads were first demultiplexed using OBITOOLS. Then erroneous sequences were removed, and singletons were filtered out. Sequences were then clustered at 97% identity using VSEARCH (10). Sequences that were found in the extraction blanks were removed from the downstream analysis. Taxonomic assignment was realized in two steps. First, sequences were assigned by blasting them against a custom database generated from the GenBank latest release curated and restricted to all the documented taxa. Sequences with over 95% identity match were kept and their last common ancestor was computed using MEGAN (11). A second assignment pass was made using a Naïve Bayesian Classifier using QIIME’s rescript plugin (12).

Data ae reported for a pre-treatment period (2010-2016) and from the onset of CO2 treatment (2017-2023). The BIFoR FACE experiment is located in central England (52.801°N, 2.301°W, 107 m above sea level) within a deciduous forest dominated by 180-year old *Quercus robur* L. trees, which represent 92% of the forest’s basal area. There are six experimental arrays of approximately 30 m diameter. Tree ring analysis was used to determine growth patterns within the arrays prior to the onset of CO2 treatment. The trees in three of the arrays have been exposed to elevated CO2 (ambient concentration + 150 ppm) during the growing seasons since 2017. Tree diameter was measured with manual dendrometers, and dry mass of oak trees was calculated using an allometric equation determined by terrestrial laser scan of the trees within the arrays. Dry matter production of understory species and coarse roots was calculated using allometric equations from the literature. Leaf production was calculated from mass of leaf litter collected in litter baskets. Fine-root production was measured in ingrowth cores and scaled to 1-meter depth based on fine-root biomass in deep cores. Exudation rates were scaled up to a full growing season and total fine-root mass.

Abarzúa: [anaabarzua@uach.cl](mailto:anaabarzua@uach.c) Alejandra Martel-Cea: [jmartel.cea@gmail.com](mailto:jmartel.cea@gmail.c);Chronology: Two sediment cores were collected in Verde (112 cm) and  Malleco (120 cm) lakes using an UWITEC gravity corer. Radionuclide  measurements using a gamma spectrometer were performed to estimate the  210Pb, 226Ra (to support 210Pb activity), and 137Cs activities on the  first 20 cm). In addition, AMS radiocarbon dating was performed in both  lakes. Radiocarbon ages were calibrated using the SHCal20 curve (Hogg et  al., 2020). The age-depth models were computed using an integrated  chronology based on 210Pb, 137Cs, and 14C dates through Bayesian analyses  in “rPlum” package (Aquino-López et al., 2018; Blaauw et al., 2020) in R  platform. Charcoal analyses: To infer fire regime, macroscopic  (&gt;125 µm) charcoal fractions were analyzed in Verde and Malleco  cores. 2 cm3 of sediment were taken at 1 cm intervals for the length of  the core, sieved through 125 μm and 250 μm screens, following the  methodology outlined by Whitlock and Larsen (2001).  Pollen analyses:  Verde and Malleco cores were subsampled for 1 cm3 (Verde) and 2 cm3 of  sediment (Malleco) at discrete 2 to 5 cm intervals. The samples were  analyzed using conventional procedures (Faegri &amp; Iversen, 1989).  To calculate pollen concentration and accumulation rate, two tablets  of Lycopodium clavatum were added to each sample (Stockmarr, 1971). Pollen  identification was carried out using a modern reference collection  (Palynology Lab-UACh) and palynological keys (Heusser, 1971; Markgraf  &amp; D'Antoni, 1978). References: Aquino-López, M.

Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publishers.;Aim: Few paleoenvironmental studies have been performed in  Araucaria-Nothofagus forests, which are highly vulnerable to ongoing  threats from climate change and anthropogenic activities. The primary goal  of this work is to reconstruct past environmental changes related to fire  disturbances over the last 1800 years in Tolhuaca National Park, Chile.  Location: Tolhuaca National Park, Araucanian region (38.2°S; 71.8°W),  Northwestern Patagonia, Chile. Taxa: Araucaria araucana (Araucariaceae),  Nothofagus spp. (Nothofagaceae). Methods: We completed charcoal and pollen  analyses to create two new paleoecological records that span 1800 years.  We compared the lake-based reconstruction with the available local  tree-ring fire scar chronologies from the last 430 years. Using these  data, we compute forest index changes, biomass burning trends, and compare  with estimates of archaeological radiocarbon density. We place our  inferences with context of published regional paleoclimatic proxies from  the Patagonian-Andean region. Results: Our results showed that fire  activity was higher than present between 200 and 1500 CE, with peaks  around 200-400 CE and 1100-1500 CE. Periods with high fire activity are  associated with reduced forest cover, as Araucaria declined when  mixed-severity fire regime occurred for extended periods. Pollen  assemblages suggested a shift from dry to wet climate conditions at 1500  CE, and from 1750 CE onward, the arrival of exotic species reflected the  land-use changes related to forest clearance and transhumance practices.  Main conclusions: The paleoenvironmental reconstructions showed changes in  vegetation, fire, and climate over the past 1800 years in TNP. Wildfires  have been the main disturbance process modifying the vegetation structure  in the Araucaria and Nothofagus forests. Since 1750 CE intensive  post-Hispanic land-use changes (forest clearances by fire and logging)  took place in the study area, reducing the native vegetation cover.  Climate variability, modulated by SAM-like and ENSO-like conditions,  influenced the fire activity (availability and flammability of fuels),  concomitantly with high archaeological density. The recent (after 2000 CE)  increase of catastrophic wildfires may negatively affect the conservation  strategies of Araucaria-Nothofagus forests.","Chronology: Two sediment cores were collected in Verde (112 cm) and  Malleco (120 cm) lakes using an UWITEC gravity corer.

See Shea and Boehm for sample collection and filtering (2023b), for  DNA extractions (2023c), for PCR amplification (2023d), and shipping  samples (2023e). Additionally, we have published all data and code for  replicating our analyses via Dryad, including FASTQ files and eDNA  datasets (pre-processing &amp; post-processing). Through Dryad and  Zenodo, our modified Anacapa Container and scripts for bioinformatics  (Shea &amp; Boehm, 2023a), as well as a GitHub repository including an  R Markdown file that reproduces all methods &amp; results (Shea  &amp; Boehm, 2023f) can also be accessed. 1.2.  Sampling Area To  better understand spatial and temporal differences in eDNA signals in a  complex coastal environment, we sought a rocky intertidal field location  that had consistent, large, accessible tide pools that were fully isolated  from one another at some low tides but interconnected during other parts  of their exposure period. We selected the intertidal at Pillar Point, a  headlands promontory to the west of Pillar Point Harbor in San Mateo  County, California, USA. Pillar Point is a popular recreational intertidal  area that is directly adjacent to the Pillar Point State Marine  Conservation Area (no specific use scientific collection permit required).  Within Pillar Point, we sampled three discrete locations: two individual  tide pools with a range of physical connectivity (Tide Pool 1, S1:  37.495306°, -122.498744°; Tide Pool 2, S2: 37.494992°, -122.498955°) and  an equidistant location (Nearshore, N: 37.495288°, -122.499198°) where  there was well-mixed offshore water for the duration of the tidal cycle.  Each site was approximately 40 meters from all other sites. Tide Pool 1  and Tide Pool 2 are fully isolated at tidal heights of around 0 m (mean  low low water, MLLW) or lower, and substantially connected at around 0.25  m or higher. On the day we sampled, this meant water actively flowed  between the locations at the start (11:30 PST) and end (17:00 PST) of the  sampling period, but the sites were disconnected at low tide in the middle  of the sampling period. Ecologically, Tide Pool 1 was located closer to  shore and interior to a channel that divides the Pillar Point intertidal,  characteristic of the high to middle intertidal. Tide Pool 2 was located  across the channel and further from shore, characteristic of the low  intertidal. 1.3.  Sample Collection &amp; Filtration We collected 1 L  surface samples from each site every 30 minutes for the duration of time  the rocky intertidal was exposed on 28 January 2022, using single-use  enteral feeding pouches (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland). The sampling volume  used, 1 L, is sufficient for detecting a representative range of marine  organisms in nearshore locations (Gold et al., 2022) and is commonly used  in aquatic eDNA studies (Takahashi et al., 2023). Sampling commenced at  11:30 PST. At each site, samples were collected from a consistent position  across time points. Following the approach used by Gold, Sprague, et al.  (2021), we attached a sterile 0.22 μm pore size Sterivex cartridge  (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) to the tubing of each feeding pouch,  allowing samples to be immediately gravity filtered in the field. While  gravity filtering (1-2 hours per sample), samples were shaded with an  awning to prevent any degradation by sunlight(Andruszkiewicz et al.,  2017). One sample fell during gravity filtration, resulting in a missing  sample from S1 at 16:00 PST. At three time points at the beginning and end  of the sampling period as well as at low tide (at 14:00 PST), we collected  triplicate 1 L samples from each location as biological replicates. At the  beginning and end of the sampling period, we also filtered 1 L MilliQ  water via the procedure described above to serve as negative field  controls. Additionally, using an Orion Model 1230 meter (Orion Research  Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), we recorded temperature and salinity in each  location directly after samples were collected. Once finished filtering,  Sterivex cartridges were dried by pushing air through them using a sterile  3 mL syringe, capped, and placed in sterile Whirl-Pak bags (Whirl-Pak,  Madison, WI, USA). Then, samples were stored in a cooler on ice until  transported back to the laboratory at the end of the sampling period.  Samples were transferred to a -20°C freezer for up to 18 days, at which  time they were processed to extract nucleic acids from the captured  materials. This sampling scheme resulted in 53 field samples. 1.4.  DNA  Extraction &amp; Library Preparation Within 18 days of collection, we  extracted and purified DNA from the Sterivex cartridge using the DNeasy  Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and the modifications  described in Spens et al. (2017). In short, we incubated the filter  cartridge overnight with proteinase K and ATL. Then, we extracted the  liquid from the cartridge with a syringe and mixed it with equal volumes  of AL buffer and 0°C ethanol before proceeding with the manufacturer’s  extraction protocol. One negative extraction control (DNA-grade water in  place of a sample) was included in each of the four batches of  extractions. Nucleic acids were stored at -20°C for up to 6 months. DNA  extractions were conducted at a lab bench distant from all subsequent  handling of PCR products.  We PCR amplified the extracted DNA in  triplicate within 6 months of storage, using the mlCOIintF/ jgHCO2198  primer set targeting a 313 bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI region  optimized by Leray et al. (2013) (Forward: GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC;  Reverse: TAIACYTCIGGRTGICCRAARAAYCA) with Nextera modifications. Following  Curd et al. (2019), we used a 25 μl PCR reaction mixture consisting of  12.5 μl of Qiagen Multiplex Mix (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), 2.5 μl each  of the forward and reverse primers at 2 μM (Integrated DNA Technologies,  Inc., Coralville, IA, USA), 6.5 μl of PCR-grade water, and 1 μl of  undiluted DNA template. The PCR thermocycling touchdown profile began with  an initial denaturation at 95° for 15 minutes to activate the DNA  polymerase, followed by 13 cycles of denaturation (94° for 30 seconds),  annealing (starting at 69.5° for 30 seconds, with the temperature  decreased by 1.5° each cycle), and extension (72° for 1 minute). Then, an  additional 35 cycles were run with the same denaturation and extension  steps as above with an annealing temperature of 50°, followed by a final  extension at 72° for 10 minutes. PCR reactions were prepared in a  designated DNA-free hood until the template was added. PCR amplification  was conducted in two batches; in each batch, we included one no-template  negative PCR control (DNA-grade water used as a template). Additionally,  we extracted and purified DNA from tissue from five organisms across a  range of phyla we expected to amplify with the mlCOIintF/ jgHCO2198  primers, but not expected to be present at Pillar Point in particular  (Mytilus edulis, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, Xiphias gladius, Mercenaria  mercenaria, Lutjanus campechanus) using the standard tissue extraction  protocol detailed in the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germantown,  MD, USA). These tissues were obtained from a local grocery store and it  was assumed that they were labeled correctly, although previous work has  indicated mislabeling in seafood stores can occur (e.g. Willette et al.,  2017). Extracts from the 5 tissue samples were combined in equimolar  amounts to form a mock community used as a positive PCR control in each  batch. Triplicate PCR amplicons from both samples and controls were not  subsequently pooled but were carried through the remaining library  preparation and sequencing steps as technical replicates. We  electrophoresed and visualized a subset of PCR products on a 1.5% agarose  gel stained with GelRed® (Biotium, Fremont, CA, USA) to ensure successful  amplification and correct product sizes as well as lack of contamination.  Post-PCR library preparation and sequencing were conducted at the Georgia  Genomics and Bioinformatics Core (GGBC, UG Athens, GA, RRID: SCR_010994).  In short, provided PCR amplicons were cleaned using AMPure XP magnetic  beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA), barcoded with Nextera  adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) during a second PCR (3 min at 95  °C; 15 cycles of 30 sec at 95 °C, 30 sec at 67 °C, and 30 sec at 72 °C;  and 4 min at 72 °C), cleaned again using AMPureXP magnetic beads, and  pooled in equimolar ratio. The resulting library was sequenced on a MiSeq  PE 2x250bp (500 cycles) using Reagent Kit V2 with 25% PhiX spike-in  (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Given our technical replication of samples  and controls, our final library included 6 negative field controls (1 at  beginning and end of field sampling, amplified in triplicate), 12 negative  extraction controls (1 in each of 4 extraction sets, amplified in  triplicate), 2 positive PCR controls (1 in each of 2 amplification  batches), 2 no-template negative PCR controls (1 in each of 2  amplification batches), and 159 samples (53 field samples, amplified in  triplicate). FASTQ files are in this Dryad repository as FASTQ_Files.zip  and are also available through the NCBI SRA (Accession: PRJNA1083727).  1.5.  Bioinformatics We processed sequencing data using the Anacapa  Toolkit, which contains two core modules: one for quality control and ASV  parsing, and one for classifying taxonomy (Curd et al., 2019). Briefly, we  ran the first module using default parameters, which uses cutadapt  (version 1.16) (Martin, 2011) for adapter and primer trimming,  FastX-Toolkit (version: 0.0.13) (Gordon &amp; Hannon, 2010) for  quality trimming, and dada2 (version 1.6) (Callahan et al., 2016) for  assigning ASVs. For the second module, we utilized the MIDORI2 reference  database, a quality-controlled and updated database built from GenBank  release 253 (20 December 2022) that has been technically validated (Leray  et al., 2022). Following Gold et al. (2022), we adjusted the identity and  query coverage to 95% (default: 80%) to account for the relative  incompleteness of the broad COI reference database compared to more  taxonomically-specific databases (Curd et al., 2019). The second module  relies on Bowtie 2 (version 2.3.5) (Langmead &amp; Salzberg, 2012) and  a modified instance of BLCA (Gao et al., 2017) as dependencies. The  Anacapa Toolkit output is in this Dryad repository as  Anacapa_Toolkit_Output.zip. Following Gold, Curd, et al. (2021) we only  kept taxonomic assignments that had a bootstrap confidence cutoff score of  60 or higher in BLCA, to avoid spurious assignments from the incomplete  reference database. We modified the Anacapa Container (Ogden, 2018), a  Singularity container with all the needed dependencies for executing the  Anacapa Toolkit, to enable the pipeline to be run in a high-performance  computing environment requiring two-step authentication; the updated  container, scripts, and reference database with the required Bowtie 2  index library needed to reproduce our bioinformatics process are archived  on Zenodo (Shea &amp; Boehm, 2023a). Raw ASVs, taxonomy assignments,  and sample information were converted into interchangeable ampvis2  (version 2.8.6) (Andersen et al., 2018) and phyloseq (version 1.46.0)  (McMurdie &amp; Holmes, 2013) objects in R (version 4.3.1) to  facilitate decontamination and further analyses. Singletons were removed  using ampvis2, and samples were further decontaminated using phyloseq by  removing all ASVs that appeared in any negative field control, negative  extraction control, or no-template negative PCR control, a choice made due  to the very low number of overlapping ASVs between samples and negative  controls (Table S1). Samples were rarified to the minimum number of reads  of any sample using ampvis2. This processed eDNA dataset is in this Dryad  repository as Processed_eDNA_Data.zip. None of these decontamination steps  changed the interpretation of subsequent analyses, as verified by  replicating all analyses with datasets representing all 8 combinations of  the presence/absence of the three decontamination and processing steps. To  ensure the accuracy of taxonomic assignments, we analyzed occurrence data  from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to investigate whether  identified species had occurrence records in the California Current System  and known ranges that encompassed Pillar Point, using the spocc (version  1.2.2) (S. Chamberlain, 2021) package. A phylogenetic tree based on  taxonomic assignments was created using the taxize (version 0.9.100) (S.  A. Chamberlain &amp; Szöcs, 2013) and ggtreeExtra (version 1.12.0) (Xu  et al., 2021) packages.  1.6.  Data Analysis To investigate whether eDNA  signals could be distinguished by location, we first analyzed  individual-level differences between locations; that is, whether ASVs or  individual taxa (agglomerated species-level taxonomic assignments) were  unique to, or associated with particular locations. We calculated and  visualized unique ASVs and taxa using the eulerr (version 7.0.0) (Larsson,  2022) package. However, with metabarcoding data in particular, taxa or  ASVs that are unique to a given location are not necessarily ecologically  meaningful; they could include rare taxa present elsewhere but not  amplified and exclude taxa that are well correlated with particular  locations but sometimes detected at others. Thus, we also analyzed ASVs  and taxa using an indicator species framework (Dufrêne &amp; Legendre,  1997). In this framework, the null hypothesis is that the frequency of  taxon or ASV presence in samples from a particular location is not higher  than the frequency of that taxon or ASV presence in samples from other  locations. For each location, we identified all statistically-significant  indicator taxa and ASVs with indicator value indices above 0.7—that is,  indicators that are well-associated with a site group even if they are  detected in samples from other sites—based on presence-absence data per  sample using the indicspecies package (version 1.7.14) (Cáceres &amp;  Legendre, 2009). We followed our individual-level analyses with approaches  to test whether community composition varied by location. We calculated a  Jaccard dissimilarity matrix across all samples using vegan (version  2.6.4) (Oksanen et al., 2022). Then, we tested for differences in  community composition among locations using a permutational multivariate  analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with the model eDNA Presence ~ Location +  Time + Biological Replicates using the adonis function in vegan. We  confirmed that locational differences found via PERMANOVA were not a  result of differences in dispersions by testing for homogeneity of  dispersions using the betadisper function in vegan. We also visualized  Jaccard dissimilarity using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)  using the metaMDS function in vegan. We coupled these analyses with a  partitioning among medoids algorithm (Kaufman &amp; Rousseeuw, 1990)  implemented with the pam function in the cluster package (version 2.1.6)  (Maechler et al., 2022). Rather than assuming location clusters a priori,  we validated the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset by finding  the number of clusters (k) that maximized the average silhouette width, a  measure of how well-structured the clusters are. Finally, to better  understand how the difference between locations varied over the time  sampled, for each time point, we calculated the Jaccard dissimilarity  between each unique combination of replicates within each site, and then  the pairwise Jaccard dissimilarity between each unique combination of  samples across the three pairs of sites: S1-N, S2-N, and S1-S2. To further  investigate whether differences in eDNA detections corresponded with  underlying ecological gradients, we compared the unique and indicator taxa  identified at each site to their ecological zonation in a highly regarded  field guide to the Pacific intertidal, Between Pacific Tides (Ricketts et  al., 1985). To account for potential variations in taxonomic names between  Between Pacific Tides and the MIDORI2 reference database, we used the  World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) to identify all synonymized names  for each unique and indicator taxon identified using the taxize (version  0.9.100) (S. A. Chamberlain &amp; Szöcs, 2013) package. Then, we  searched Between Pacific Tides for all synonyms, both manually using the  index and in R by extracting the text from a PDF of Between Pacific Tides  using the pdftools package (version 3.4.0) (Ooms, 2023). We compared the  proportion of Zone 1 (uppermost horizon), Zone 2 (high intertidal), and  Zone 3 (middle intertidal) species were identified across each location  using a chi-squared test with p-values computed via Monte Carlo  simulation. 1.7.  Citations Andersen, K.

More details on sequencing methods  can be found in the \Methods\ section on Dryad and the  manuscript. The zip file also contains FASTA files of the forward and  reverse COI primers used. These FASTA and FASTQ files are formatted for  use with the modified Anacapa Container described below. ###  Anacapa\\_Toolkit\\_Output.zip This archive contains the unprocessed output  from a run of the modified Anacapa Container on 31 January 2023 on the  FASTQ files contained in FASTQ_Files.zip. In the archive are three  folders: #### CO1 This folder contains the primary Anacapa Container  output. The top level contains two summary .txt files. *  CO1_ASV_taxonomy_brief.txt: The rows are each ASV generated through the  Anacapa Container, and columns are each eDNA sample. The numbers reflect  the number of sequence reads of a given ASV in a given sample. The final  columns contain the taxonomic classification of the given ASV, if any, the  confidence level for each taxonomic assignment, and accession numbers. *  CO1_ASV_taxonomy_detailed.txt: This contains the same information as  CO1_ASV_taxonomy_brief.txt, but has some additional columns.  \sequence\, \sequencesF\, and \sequencesR\  include the sequence information for the given ASV. Several additional  columns are added by the Anacapa Container automatically, but are not used  for any subsequent analysis or interpretation, including:  \forward_CO1_seq_number\, \merged_CO1_seq_number\,  \reverse_CO1_seq_number\, \single_or_multiple_hit\,  \end_to_end_or_local\, \max_percent_id\, and  \input_sequence_length\ Then, there is a  \Summary_by_percent_confidence\ folder generated that has inner  folders (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 100) for identifying only those  taxonomic assignments from the Anacapa Container output that had a  bootstrap confidence cutoff score of FOLDER-NAME or higher in BLCA. Each  folder contains two .txt files, in identifical formats across folders. *  CO1_ASV_raw_taxonomy_FOLDER-NAME.txt: The rows are each ASV generated  through the Anacapa Container, and columns are each eDNA sample. The  numbers reflect the number of sequence reads of a given ASV in a given  sample. The final columns contain the taxonomic classification of the  given ASV, if any, the confidence level for each taxonomic assignment, and  accession numbers. This is an identical format to  CO1_ASV_taxonomy_brief.txt above. *  CO1_ASV_sum_by_taxonomy_FOLDER-NAME.txt: The rows are each unique  taxonomic assignment, summed across all ASVs from  CO1_ASV_raw_taxonomy_FOLDER-NAME.txt with the same assignment, and columns  are each eDNA sample. The numbers reflect the number of sequence reads of  a given taxonomic assignment in a given sample. #### Metadata-Added This  folder contains four .txt files that include the metadata that we compiled  to integrate with the Anacapa Container output. Most of the information  contained in these files gets synthesized into the SampleData.csv file in  the Processed-eDNA_Data.zip archive below. *  PillarPoint_Sample_Info_EnviroData.txt: contains the \T\  (temperature; Degrees Celsius) and \S\ (salinity; ppt) measured  at each time (PST) and location combination with an Orion Model 1230 meter  (Orion Research Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) *  PillarPoint_SampleInfo_FieldSampling.txt: contains the sample number for  each sample, its corresponding field time (PST) and location, and the  extraction group in which it was processed in the laboratory *  PillarPoint_SampleInfo_Location.txt: contains the GPS coordinates for the  three sampling locations * PillarPoint_SampleInfo_Sequencing.txt: contains  the sample name, several descriptive portions of the sample name, whether  it is a \sample\ or \control\, and the PCR plate in  which it was processed in the laboratory #### Run\\_info This folder  contains a variety of scripts, outputs, and logs generated automatically  during a run of the modified Anacapa Container. These will likely only be  relevant to users who are trying to run the modified Anacapa Container  (see below) on their own, and need to troubleshoot why their output is not  identical to our output. More details on these files, and the Anacapa  Toolkit pipeline, can be found on its original GitHub page. ###  Processed\\_eDNA\\_Data.zip This archive contains processed versions of the  ASVs, taxonomy assignments, and sample information from the Anacapa  Toolkit Output. More details on processing can be found in the  \Methods\ section on Dryad and in the manuscript, but in short,  we used only taxonomic assignments from the Anacapa Toolkit output (above)  that had a bootstrap confidence cutoff score of 60 or higher in BLCA.  Then, we removed singletons; we removed all ASVs that appeared in any  negative field control, negative extraction control, or no-template  negative PCR control; and we rarefied to the minimum number of reads of  any sample. These processing steps can also all be found and reproduced in  PillarPoint.Rmd in the Intertidal-eDNA GitHub Repo. The processed eDNA  dataset represents the core dataset analyzed in the manuscript. In the  archive are three .csv files: ASVTable.csv, SampleData.csv, and  TaxTable.csv. #### ASVTable.csv Rows are each ASV generated through the  Anacapa Toolkit pipeline, and columns are each eDNA sample. The numbers  reflect the number of sequence reads of a given ASV in a given sample.  #### SampleData.csv This file contains 12 columns of additional context  for the eDNA samples listed in ASVTable.csv: * \Sample\  &amp; \X\: contain the same eDNA sample names from  ASVTable.csv * \Sample_Name\ &amp;  \Dereplicated_Sample_Name\: extract descriptive portions of the  full sample name that are useful for differentiating samples *  \Type\: describes whether a given row represents a sample or a  control * \PCR\: denotes whether a sample was processed in the  first or second PCR plate during laboratory work * \Time\:  sample collection time (PST) * \Location\: sample collection  location (S1, S2 or N; context for these locations in section 1.2 of Dryad  Methods or in manuscript) * \Extraction\: denotes the group in  which this sample was extracted during laboratory work * \T\  &amp; \S\: the temperature (Degrees Celsius) and salinity  (ppt) measured at the time the sample was collected with an Orion Model  1230 meter (Orion Research Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) *  \SiteByTime\: a composite of \Location\ and  \Time\ columns used to differentiate samples in some analyses  #### TaxTable.csv Rows are each ASV generated through the Anacapa Toolkit  pipeline (same as ASVTable.csv), and columns are the taxonomic information  assigned to that ASV, if any, through the Anacapa Toolkit pipeline. ##  Related Works: Software, Code, and Data ### Anacapa Container (modified)  The modified Anacapa Container, published to Zenodo and found in the  \Related Works\ on Dryad, is the workflow used to process  FASTQ_Files.zip. The output from this workflow is  Anacapa_Toolkit_Output.zip. More details on the Anacapa Container and how  it works can be found on its Zenodo page. ### Intertidal-eDNA GitHub  Repository The Intertidal-eDNA GitHub repository, published to Zenodo and  found in the \Related Works\ on Dryad, contains all of the data  and code needed to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript, starting from  Anacapa_Toolkit_Output.zip (which is already included in the repo). Using  PillarPoint.Rmd, you can generate the processed eDNA dataset saved here as  Processed_eDNA_Data.zip and use that dataset to reproduce all of the  analyses, as well as most of the figures, in the manuscript. More details  on the Intertidal-eDNA GitHub repository can be found on its Zenodo page.  ### NCBI SRA Sequence Data Submission The FASTQ files in FASTQ_Files.zip  have also been submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive; the BioProject  containing all of these files can be found with accession: PRJNA1083727.  #### GBIF and OBIS Biodiversity Data Submission Biodiversity data  generated from this project has also been submitted to the Global  Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Ocean Biodiversity  Information System (OBIS). It is important to note that the biodiversity  information submitted to GBIF/OBIS differs slightly from the  Processed_eDNA_Data.zip files above, since best practices for submitting  DNA-derived data to GBIF recommend not rarefying to the minimum number of  reads of any sample and not including an controls. The exact data  submitted to GBIF/OBIS can be produced through the Intertidal-eDNA GithUb  repository published to Zenodo.;While the utility of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding surveys for  biodiversity monitoring continues to be demonstrated, the spatial and  temporal variability of eDNA, and thus the limits of the differentiability  of an eDNA signal, remains under-characterized. In this study, we  collected eDNA samples from distinct micro-habitats (~40 m apart) in a  rocky intertidal ecosystem over their exposure period in a tidal cycle.  During this period, the micro-habitats transitioned from being  interconnected, to physically isolated, to interconnected again. Using a  well-established eukaryotic (cytochrome oxidase subunit I) metabarcoding  assay, we detected 415 species across 28 phyla. Across a variety of  univariate and multivariate analyses, using exclusively taxonomically  assigned data as well as all detected amplicon sequence variants (ASVs),  we identified unique eDNA signals from the different micro-habitats  sampled. This difference paralleled expected ecological gradients and  increased as the sites became more physically disconnected. Our results  demonstrate that eDNA biomonitoring can differentiate micro-habitats in  the rocky intertidal only 40 m apart, that these differences reflect known  ecology in the area, and that physical connectivity informs the degree of  differentiation possible. These findings showcase the potential power of  eDNA biomonitoring to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of  marine biodiversity data, aiding research, conservation, and management  efforts.","# Environmental DNA metabarcoding differentiates between micro-habitats  within the rocky intertidal This repository includes the necessary data to  process marine eDNA metabarcoding samples collected from Pillar Point,  Half Moon Bay, CA, USA on 28 January 2022. ## Description of Data, Code,  &amp; File Structure ### FASTQ\\_Files.zip This archive contains  compressed FASTQ sequencing files generated from an Illumina MiSeq PE  2x250bp (500 cycles) sequencing run. More details on sequencing methods  can be found in the \Methods\ section on Dryad and the  manuscript. The zip file also contains FASTA files of the forward and  reverse COI primers used. These FASTA and FASTQ files are formatted for  use with the modified Anacapa Container described below. ###  Anacapa\\_Toolkit\\_Output.zip This archive contains the unprocessed output  from a run of the modified Anacapa Container on 31 January 2023 on the  FASTQ files contained in FASTQ_Files.zip. In the archive are three  folders: #### CO1 This folder contains the primary Anacapa Container  output. The top level contains two summary .txt files. *  CO1_ASV_taxonomy_brief.txt: The rows are each ASV generated through the  Anacapa Container, and columns are each eDNA sample. The numbers reflect  the number of sequence reads of a given ASV in a given sample. The final  columns contain the taxonomic classification of the given ASV, if any, the  confidence level for each taxonomic assignment, and accession numbers. *  CO1_ASV_taxonomy_detailed.txt: This contains the same information as  CO1_ASV_taxonomy_brief.txt, but has some additional columns.  \sequence\, \sequencesF\, and \sequencesR\  include the sequence information for the given ASV. Several additional  columns are added by the Anacapa Container automatically, but are not used  for any subsequent analysis or interpretation, including:  \forward_CO1_seq_number\, \merged_CO1_seq_number\,  \reverse_CO1_seq_number\, \single_or_multiple_hit\,  \end_to_end_or_local\, \max_percent_id\, and  \input_sequence_length\ Then, there is a  \Summary_by_percent_confidence\ folder generated that has inner  folders (40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 100) for identifying only those  taxonomic assignments from the Anacapa Container output that had a  bootstrap confidence cutoff score of FOLDER-NAME or higher in BLCA. Each  folder contains two .txt files, in identifical formats across folders. *  CO1_ASV_raw_taxonomy_FOLDER-NAME.txt: The rows are each ASV generated  through the Anacapa Container, and columns are each eDNA sample. The  numbers reflect the number of sequence reads of a given ASV in a given  sample. The final columns contain the taxonomic classification of the  given ASV, if any, the confidence level for each taxonomic assignment, and  accession numbers. This is an identical format to  CO1_ASV_taxonomy_brief.txt above. *  CO1_ASV_sum_by_taxonomy_FOLDER-NAME.txt: The rows are each unique  taxonomic assignment, summed across all ASVs from  CO1_ASV_raw_taxonomy_FOLDER-NAME.txt with the same assignment, and columns  are each eDNA sample. The numbers reflect the number of sequence reads of  a given taxonomic assignment in a given sample. #### Metadata-Added This  folder contains four .txt files that include the metadata that we compiled  to integrate with the Anacapa Container output. Most of the information  contained in these files gets synthesized into the SampleData.csv file in  the Processed-eDNA_Data.zip archive below. *  PillarPoint_Sample_Info_EnviroData.txt: contains the \T\  (temperature; Degrees Celsius) and \S\ (salinity; ppt) measured  at each time (PST) and location combination with an Orion Model 1230 meter  (Orion Research Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) *  PillarPoint_SampleInfo_FieldSampling.txt: contains the sample number for  each sample, its corresponding field time (PST) and location, and the  extraction group in which it was processed in the laboratory *  PillarPoint_SampleInfo_Location.txt: contains the GPS coordinates for the  three sampling locations * PillarPoint_SampleInfo_Sequencing.txt: contains  the sample name, several descriptive portions of the sample name, whether  it is a \sample\ or \control\, and the PCR plate in  which it was processed in the laboratory #### Run\\_info This folder  contains a variety of scripts, outputs, and logs generated automatically  during a run of the modified Anacapa Container.

The collection includes 36  different samples of agarwood chips, dried Aquilaria spp. wood (also known  as \bahkour\), and 22 agarwood steam-distillate oils, known as  \oudh\. The ages of the plants at harvest and origins of these  samples cannot be accurately traced; however, many were labelled with  their country of origin. The samples varied in price at the time of  purchase, reflecting their purported rarity, the density of fragrant  compounds, and complexity of aromatic notes (Supplementary Table 1). It  was determined that the appropriate organic solvent for extraction was  acetone based on preliminary analysis with different solvents, and each  agarwood sample was then diluted to obtain chromatograms with clear peaks  for product detection and identification. All samples were processed  within 16 weeks of being procured. The wood samples were weighed (1 g) and  ground into a fine powder using a combination of freeze–thaw cycles with  liquid nitrogen and mechanical grinding. The homogenised samples were  immersed in 5 mL of 1:1 hexane:acetone and subjected to ultrasonic  agitation at 40°C for 8 h to facilitate terpenoid extraction. The samples  were then passed through a 0.2 µm filter to obtain clear solvent extracts  that were evaporated under a nitrogen stream for 20 min to concentrate the  terpenoids in the samples. Concentrated samples were resuspended in 500 µL  acetone and stored at –20°C until gas chromatography–flame-ionisation  detector and mass spectrometry (GC–MS/FID) and two-dimensional gas  chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC–TOF/MS)  analyses. All photographs were captured with a Canon EOS RP camera using a  Canon RF 24–105 mm f/4-7.1 IS STM lens (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) and  ColorChecker Passport (CCPP2, Calibrite LLC, DE, USA) used for colour  calibration. Algal strain cultivation Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain  UPN22 was used for all experiments. C. reinhardtii UPN22 is a derivative  of the UVM4 strain. It has been genetically enhanced to use phosphite and  nitrate as a sole source of phosphorous and nitrogen, respectively, to  minimise contamination and maximise cell densities in cultivation. Strains  were cultured in Tris-acetate phosphite nitrate (TAPhi-NO3) liquid medium  with shaking at 120 rpm or on solid agar and 150 µmol m–2 s–1 light  intensity from a combination of cool- and warm white LED tubes (light  spectra as reported in). 500 mL algal cultures were agitated with stirring  in Erlenmeyer flasks under the same growth conditions. Plasmid  construction, algal transformation, and screening for sesquiterpenoid  synthase expression Heterologous expression of sesquiterpenoid synthases  (STPSs) in C. reinhardtii was achieved through synthetic transgene  redesign based on the amino-acid sequences of each STPS, following  previously established protocols. We selected 21 STPSs from various  species encoding isoforms that yield nine different STP skeletons (Table  1). Targeted STPSs for aristolochene, δ-guaiene, santalene, valencene,  valerianol, zizaene, τ-cadinol, bisabolol, and patchoulol were designed;  all accession numbers are listed in Table 1. Their amino-acid sequences  were used to generate algal-adapted nucleotide coding sequences using the  Intronserter programme. This programme back-translates amino-acid  sequences to frequently used codons, removes unwanted restriction sites,  and systematically integrates the first intron of CrRBCS2i1 at a set  distance to enable expression from the C. reinhardtii nuclear genome, as  previously reported. Algal-adapted coding sequences were synthesised and  sub-cloned into pOptimized_3 expression plasmids by Genscript (Piscataway,  NJ, USA). Ketocarotenoid biosynthesis in alga was achieved by  transformation with the pOpt2_CrBKT_aadA plasmid, and knockdown of C.  reinhardtii squalene synthase (Uniprot: A8IE29) was achieved using the  previously reported luciferase–artificial microRNA expression plasmid  pOpt2_ cCA_gLuc-TAA_i3_ami_Spec. Both plasmids confer resistance to  spectinomycin as a selectable marker. Combining both cassettes into a  single plasmid was unsuccessful. Co-transformation of both plasmids and  selection on spectinomycin was combined with robotics assisted colony  picking and plate-level screening of 768 transformants to find those with  luciferase activity (indicative of SQS knockdown) and a brown-colony  phenotype from CrBKT-mediated ketocarotenoid biosynthesis. All plasmid  constructs used are listed in Supplementary Table 6 and the complete  annotated plasmid sequences are available in Supplementary File 5. The  glass-bead protocol was used to transform the nuclear genome of C.  reinhardtii with a plasmid DNA. Each plasmid was linearised using  restriction enzymes (XbaI + KpnI, Thermo Scientific FastDigest), and 10 µg  of DNA was used for each transformation. Following an ~8 h recovery period  in liquid TAPhi-NO3 medium under low light, algal cells were plated on a  selective medium with paromomycin (10 µg mL–1), spectinomycin (200  µg mL–1) or zeocin (15 µg mL—1) antibiotics either individual or  combinations of selection agents relative to each target plasmid. Plates  were illuminated continuously for ~7 d before colony picking. A PIXL robot  (Singer Instruments, Watchet, UK) transferred up to 384 colonies per  transformation event to TAPhi-NO3 agar plates. After an additional 3 d, a  ROTOR robot (Singer Instruments) was used to replicate colonies onto new  medium and plates containing amido black (150 µg mL–1) for fluorescence  screening as previously described. All algal-optimised STPSs were  expressed as fusions with mVenus (yellow fluorescent protein) or the  monomeric teal (cyan) fluorescent protein 1 (mTFP1). Transgene expression  of each STPS was determined by fluorescence imaging at the agar-plate  level, as previously described. Chlorophyll fluorescence was observed with  2 sec of 475/20 nm excitation and 640/160 nm emission to show colony  presence/absence on amido black-containing plates. Cyan-green fluorescence  was captured with 420/20 nm excitation and 480/20 nm emission filters  using 2.5 min exposure. Yellow fluorescent signals were captured with  504/10 nm excitation and 530/10 nm emission filters with 30-sec exposures.  Transformants displaying strong fluorescent-protein signals were selected  and inoculated into 12-well plates containing 2 mL of liquid TAPhi-NO3  medium and grown with shaking at 160 rpm. Predicted molecular masses of  the expressed heterologous STPS–FP fusions were verified using sodium  dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) in-gel  fluorescence against the fusion-protein fluorescent reporter. Heterologous  sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis analyses For each transformant, biosynthesis  of heterologous STPs was assessed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  (GC–MS/FID). Four individual transformants containing each plasmid with  the highest fluorescence signals were selected, and solvent–culture  two-phase living extractions were performed using a 10% v/v  dodecane–culture overlay in 6-well plates, as previously reported17,53.  Cultivations were performed in biological triplicate for 6 d in 4.5 mL  TAPhi-NO3 media with 500 µL dodecane overlay. Phases were separated, and  culture samples were taken for cell-density analysis by flow cytometry as  previously described, and dodecane was spun at 20,000 x g for 3 min,  then  150 µL clarified solvent was transferred into amber GC vials in triplicate  prior to analysis. Samples were analysed as previously described using an  Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer and a  flame-ionisation detector (GC–MS/FID). The gas chromatograph comprises a  5975C inert MSD with a triple-axis detector and a DB-5MS column (30 m ×  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). The injector, interface, and  ion-source temperature profiles were set to 250°C, 250°C, and 220°C,  respectively. In splitless mode, 1 μL of the sample was injected using an  autosampler (G4513A, Agilent). The column flow was constant at 1 mL min−1,  with helium as carrier gas. The initial GC oven temperature was set to  80°C for 1 min, increased to 120°C at 10°C min−1, raised to 160°C at 3°C  min−1, and to 240°C at 10°C min−1, holding for 3 min. After a 12-min  solvent delay, mass spectra were recorded using a scanning range of 50–750  m/z at 20 scans per second. Chromatograms were analysed with MassHunter  Workstation software version B.08.00 (Agilent), and STPs were identified  using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library  (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Further identification was conducted with  purified standard calibration curves ranging from concentrations of  1–1,200 μM in dodecane of δ-guaiene (CAT#B942760), patchoulol  (CAT#P206200), santalene (CAT#S15065), valerianol (CAT#V914000, Toronto  Research Chemicals, ON, Canada), bisabolol (CAT#95426), valencene  (CAT#06808), cedrene (CAT#22133, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) (Supplementary  Fig. 6). For compound identification, retention-time acquisition, internal  digital-library calibration, and method development, we used a set of 12  microampules containing a standard terpene mixture, which covered 98  terpenes at 1 mM in methanol (CAT# MSITPN101, MetaSci, ON, Canada,  Supplementary Table 4). Two-dimensional Gas chromatography time-of-flight  mass spectrometry (GCxGC–TOF/MS) analysis Comprehensive two-dimensional  gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC–TOF/MS)  analysis of agarwood and distillate extracts in acetone was performed  using an Agilent 7890B gas-chromatography system equipped with a Zoex ZX1  cryogenic thermal modulator and a JEOL TOF MS (AccuTOF GCx-plus, JEOL,  Japan). The GCxGC system featured a normal (non-polar x mid-polar)  two-dimensional column configuration, comprising a first-dimension column  with a 30 m non-polar HP-5MS UI capillary column  (5%-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane) and a second-dimension column with a 2 m  mid-polar BPX-50 capillary column (50% phenyl polysilphenylene-siloxane).  We used helium (99.999%) as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 0.8  mL min−1. The GCxGC–TOF/MS injector temperature was maintained at 300°C  with a 10:1 split ratio. The oven temperature was initially held at 80°C  for 1 min, then increased to 325°C at 2°C min−1. The modulation period was  set at 6 s with a pulse time of 0.35 ms. The mass spectrometer operated in  electron ionisation (EI+) mode at 70 eV. Both the transfer-line and  ion-source temperatures were maintained at 250°C. The detector voltage of  TOF was set to 2,500 Volts, and data were acquired at a rate of 50 Hz.  Mass spectra were obtained within a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) from 50 to  600. Gas chromatography data analysis The analysis of terpenoid extracts  followed a procedure similar to previously reported methods, and  qualitative analyses primarily relied on the retention index and match  factor. The GC–MS/FID data were processed using the MassHunter Workstation  software version B.08.00 (Agilent Technologies, USA). The identification  of compounds was assisted by the NIST Mass Spectral Library Version 2.3  (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).  The mass-spectral data, derived from the GCxGC–TOF/MS analysis, were  evaluated with GC ImageTM Version 2.9 software (Lincoln, NE, USA) and  referenced against the NIST2020/EPA/NIH EI Mass Spectral Library. The  spectral data were cross-referenced with library spectra to identify  potential chemical structures, facilitated by calculating the match factor  and probability, thereby generating a list of probable compound matches.  The match factor directly compares the unknown mass spectrum peaks with  those in the library spectra, indicating their similarity. In contrast,  the probability determines the relative likelihood of the list of hits  being accurate, assuming that the unknown spectrum is present in the  library. Using these metrics provides the relative assuredness of matching  chemical structures within the library spectra. Sesquiterpenoid production  and concentration Transformants of best-performing STPS isoforms that  accumulated the most of each heterologous sesquiterpenoid in screening  conditions, were subjected to solvent–culture two-phase cultivations at  300 mL scale in TAPhi-NO3 medium using FC-3283 as a solvent underlay  phase, as previously described. FC-3283 is a perfluorinated amine that is  inert and denser than water, forming an underlay to the culture and  accumulating heterologous terpene products from the algae. After 6 days of  cultivation, gravity and gentle centrifugation separated the fluorocarbon  and cultures. After centrifugation to clarify, fluorocarbons were  subjected to liquid–liquid extraction to partition accumulated STPs into  an equal volume of 96% ethanol. The mixture was shaken for 16 h at room  temperature at 200 rpm. Next, samples were again centrifuged gently to  further separate the phases. FC-3283, after ethanol extraction, can be  reused on algal cultures and is effectively recycled in this process. 500  μL aliquots from each phase were sampled and stored in separate GC vials  at –20°C for subsequent analysis and separation performance  quantification. For each of the nine STPs biosynthesised by the algae, 20  mL 96% ethanol-containing STOs were generated. The ethanol fractions were  pooled and subjected to organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) in a dead-end  cell to concentrate the terpenes in ethanol without evaporative losses. A  Duramem solvent-resistant membrane (Evonik, Germany) with a nominal  molecular weight cut-off value of 300 g mol–1 suitable for STP retention  and chemical compatibility with ethanol was selected. The 200 mL  ethanol–sesquiterpenoid mixture was loaded into the OSN chamber containing  a 16 mm membrane disc and subjected to 20 bar pressure delivered by CO2 as  an inert gas, to drive the ethanol phase through the nanofiltration  membrane at 2.84 L m–2 h–1 flux. While ethanol permeated the membrane,  STPs were kept in the retentate due to their molecular weight and  consequently concentrated in the ethanol. The permeate ethanol is suitable  for recycling and can be reused in subsequent liquid–liquid extraction  processes. Bulk hydroxylation of sesquiterpenoid backbones To selectively  introduce hydroxyl groups at the double bonds present in the terpenes,  hydroboration-oxidation reactions were performed using two distinct  organoboron reagents: borane–tetrahydrofuran complex (BH3·THF)  (CAT#176192, Sigma-Aldrich) and 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (151076,  Sigma-Aldrich). Three different stoichiometric ratios (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0)  were explored for each reagent to investigate different degrees of  hydroxylation within the STP mixture. The sterically hindered 9-BBN was  anticipated to selectively react with the least sterically demanding sites  of the terpenes, while the borane–tetrahydrofuran complex was expected to  facilitate hydroxylation even at the more challenging endocyclic  positions. To remove residual ethanol and water content from the  concentrated terpene mixture, a rotary evaporator was used under reduced  pressure at 40°C, ensuring effective removal without compromising the  integrity of the terpenes. To ensure the complete removal of water,  molecular sieves (CAT#105734, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the terpene–THF  solvent mixture. The reactions were carried out in anhydrous  tetrahydrofuran (THF, Sigma-Aldrich) to enable removal by evaporation  after completion. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%, VWR Chemicals) and sodium  hydroxide aqueous solution (NaOH, Sigma-Aldrich) were used to convert the  organoboron intermediates into non-toxic, water-soluble boric acid after  the reaction. All subsequent terpene derivatives were extracted from the  aqueous mixture with ethyl acetate. Data analysis To evaluate the impact  of engineered modifications on STP biosynthesis and growth characteristics  in C. reinhardtii strains, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was  performed to compare mean STP (patchoulol) titres and growth rates among  different transformants and the parental control strain. This statistical  approach allowed for the simultaneous analysis of differences between  multiple groups, to provide a robust assessment of the experimental  manipulations. ANOVAs were performed separately for STP titres and growth  rates under mixotrophic and phototrophic conditions. Post-hoc pairwise  comparisons using Tukey's HSD were conducted to identify which groups  were statistically significantly different. A one-way ANOVA was used to  assess the effects of differences in STP biosynthesis among tested  strategies (single or double transformation), followed by a post hoc  Tukey's HSD test for specific pairwise data-set comparisons. Mean  production values (in fg cell–1 and mg L–1) for each STP were compared,  considering standard deviations to evaluate data variability. Mean values  were considered statistically significantly different at a level of p  &lt; 0.05. For data analyses, JMP v.16 (SAS Institute Inc, NC, USA)  and Rstudio 3.6.2 (Posit Software, Boston, USA) were used. Data  visualisation was done using JMP v.16 and GraphPad Prism v.10 (GraphPad  Software, MA, USA). Image adjustments involved ColourChecker calibration  (Calibrite LLC, DE, USA) paired with Adobe Lightroom (Adobe Inc., CA, USA)  for colour accuracy. The Gardner Colour Scale was used for agarwood sample  assessment. Images were cropped and organised in Affinity Photo v.1.10.6  (Serif Ltd., WB, UK). Analysis of images and assignment of colour values  according to the Gardner scale was conducted using ImageJ software (NIH,  USA). Diagrams and illustrations were made using Affinity Designer  v.1.10.6 (Serif Ltd., WB, UK), chemical structures with ChemDraw v.20.1  (PerkinElmer, MA, USA) and all visual elements were harmonised in Affinity  Publisher v.1.10.6 (Serif Ltd., WB, UK).;Certain endangered Thymelaeaceous trees are major sources of the fragrant  and highly valued resinous agarwood, comprised of hundreds of oxygenated  sesquiterpenoids (STPs). Despite growing pressure on natural agarwood  sources, the chemical complexity of STPs severely limits synthetic  production. Here, we catalogued the chemical diversity in 58 agarwood  samples by two-dimensional gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and  partially recreated complex STP mixtures through synthetic biology. We  improved STP yields in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by  combinatorial engineering to biosynthesise nine macrocyclic STP backbones  found in agarwood. A bioprocess following green-chemistry principles was  developed that exploits ‘milking’ of STPs without cell lysis,  solvent–solvent STP extraction, solvent–STP nanofiltration, and bulk STP  oxy-functionalisation to obtain terpene mixtures like those of agarwood.  This process occurs with total solvent recycling and enables continuous  production. Our synthetic-biology approach offers a sustainable  alternative to harvesting agarwood trees to obtain mixtures of complex,  fragrant, oxygenated STPs.","Agarwood sample collection and processing Agarwood samples were procured  from the old-town market \Al Balad\ in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia  (21.481° N, 39.187° E) in Winter 2023. The collection includes 36  different samples of agarwood chips, dried Aquilaria spp. wood (also known  as \bahkour\), and 22 agarwood steam-distillate oils, known as  \oudh\. The ages of the plants at harvest and origins of these  samples cannot be accurately traced; however, many were labelled with  their country of origin. The samples varied in price at the time of  purchase, reflecting their purported rarity, the density of fragrant  compounds, and complexity of aromatic notes (Supplementary Table 1). It  was determined that the appropriate organic solvent for extraction was  acetone based on preliminary analysis with different solvents, and each  agarwood sample was then diluted to obtain chromatograms with clear peaks  for product detection and identification. All samples were processed  within 16 weeks of being procured. The wood samples were weighed (1 g) and  ground into a fine powder using a combination of freeze–thaw cycles with  liquid nitrogen and mechanical grinding. The homogenised samples were  immersed in 5 mL of 1:1 hexane:acetone and subjected to ultrasonic  agitation at 40°C for 8 h to facilitate terpenoid extraction. The samples  were then passed through a 0.2 µm filter to obtain clear solvent extracts  that were evaporated under a nitrogen stream for 20 min to concentrate the  terpenoids in the samples. Concentrated samples were resuspended in 500 µL  acetone and stored at –20°C until gas chromatography–flame-ionisation  detector and mass spectrometry (GC–MS/FID) and two-dimensional gas  chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC–TOF/MS)  analyses. All photographs were captured with a Canon EOS RP camera using a  Canon RF 24–105 mm f/4-7.1 IS STM lens (Canon, Tokyo, Japan) and  ColorChecker Passport (CCPP2, Calibrite LLC, DE, USA) used for colour  calibration. Algal strain cultivation Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain  UPN22 was used for all experiments. C. reinhardtii UPN22 is a derivative  of the UVM4 strain. It has been genetically enhanced to use phosphite and  nitrate as a sole source of phosphorous and nitrogen, respectively, to  minimise contamination and maximise cell densities in cultivation.

Plasmid  construction, algal transformation, and screening for sesquiterpenoid  synthase expression Heterologous expression of sesquiterpenoid synthases  (STPSs) in C. reinhardtii was achieved through synthetic transgene  redesign based on the amino-acid sequences of each STPS, following  previously established protocols. We selected 21 STPSs from various  species encoding isoforms that yield nine different STP skeletons (Table  1). Targeted STPSs for aristolochene, δ-guaiene, santalene, valencene,  valerianol, zizaene, τ-cadinol, bisabolol, and patchoulol were designed;  all accession numbers are listed in Table 1. Their amino-acid sequences  were used to generate algal-adapted nucleotide coding sequences using the  Intronserter programme. This programme back-translates amino-acid  sequences to frequently used codons, removes unwanted restriction sites,  and systematically integrates the first intron of CrRBCS2i1 at a set  distance to enable expression from the C. reinhardtii nuclear genome, as  previously reported. Algal-adapted coding sequences were synthesised and  sub-cloned into pOptimized_3 expression plasmids by Genscript (Piscataway,  NJ, USA). Ketocarotenoid biosynthesis in alga was achieved by  transformation with the pOpt2_CrBKT_aadA plasmid, and knockdown of C.  reinhardtii squalene synthase (Uniprot: A8IE29) was achieved using the  previously reported luciferase–artificial microRNA expression plasmid  pOpt2_ cCA_gLuc-TAA_i3_ami_Spec. Both plasmids confer resistance to  spectinomycin as a selectable marker. Combining both cassettes into a  single plasmid was unsuccessful. Co-transformation of both plasmids and  selection on spectinomycin was combined with robotics assisted colony  picking and plate-level screening of 768 transformants to find those with  luciferase activity (indicative of SQS knockdown) and a brown-colony  phenotype from CrBKT-mediated ketocarotenoid biosynthesis. All plasmid  constructs used are listed in Supplementary Table 6 and the complete  annotated plasmid sequences are available in Supplementary File 5. The  glass-bead protocol was used to transform the nuclear genome of C.  reinhardtii with a plasmid DNA. Each plasmid was linearised using  restriction enzymes (XbaI + KpnI, Thermo Scientific FastDigest), and 10 µg  of DNA was used for each transformation. Following an ~8 h recovery period  in liquid TAPhi-NO3 medium under low light, algal cells were plated on a  selective medium with paromomycin (10 µg mL–1), spectinomycin (200  µg mL–1) or zeocin (15 µg mL—1) antibiotics either individual or  combinations of selection agents relative to each target plasmid. Plates  were illuminated continuously for ~7 d before colony picking. A PIXL robot  (Singer Instruments, Watchet, UK) transferred up to 384 colonies per  transformation event to TAPhi-NO3 agar plates. After an additional 3 d, a  ROTOR robot (Singer Instruments) was used to replicate colonies onto new  medium and plates containing amido black (150 µg mL–1) for fluorescence  screening as previously described. All algal-optimised STPSs were  expressed as fusions with mVenus (yellow fluorescent protein) or the  monomeric teal (cyan) fluorescent protein 1 (mTFP1). Transgene expression  of each STPS was determined by fluorescence imaging at the agar-plate  level, as previously described. Chlorophyll fluorescence was observed with  2 sec of 475/20 nm excitation and 640/160 nm emission to show colony  presence/absence on amido black-containing plates. Cyan-green fluorescence  was captured with 420/20 nm excitation and 480/20 nm emission filters  using 2.5 min exposure. Yellow fluorescent signals were captured with  504/10 nm excitation and 530/10 nm emission filters with 30-sec exposures.  Transformants displaying strong fluorescent-protein signals were selected  and inoculated into 12-well plates containing 2 mL of liquid TAPhi-NO3  medium and grown with shaking at 160 rpm. Predicted molecular masses of  the expressed heterologous STPS–FP fusions were verified using sodium  dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) in-gel  fluorescence against the fusion-protein fluorescent reporter. Heterologous  sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis analyses For each transformant, biosynthesis  of heterologous STPs was assessed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  (GC–MS/FID). Four individual transformants containing each plasmid with  the highest fluorescence signals were selected, and solvent–culture  two-phase living extractions were performed using a 10% v/v  dodecane–culture overlay in 6-well plates, as previously reported17,53.  Cultivations were performed in biological triplicate for 6 d in 4.5 mL  TAPhi-NO3 media with 500 µL dodecane overlay. Phases were separated, and  culture samples were taken for cell-density analysis by flow cytometry as  previously described, and dodecane was spun at 20,000 x g for 3 min,  then  150 µL clarified solvent was transferred into amber GC vials in triplicate  prior to analysis. Samples were analysed as previously described using an  Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer and a  flame-ionisation detector (GC–MS/FID). The gas chromatograph comprises a  5975C inert MSD with a triple-axis detector and a DB-5MS column (30 m ×  0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). The injector, interface, and  ion-source temperature profiles were set to 250°C, 250°C, and 220°C,  respectively. In splitless mode, 1 μL of the sample was injected using an  autosampler (G4513A, Agilent). The column flow was constant at 1 mL min−1,  with helium as carrier gas. The initial GC oven temperature was set to  80°C for 1 min, increased to 120°C at 10°C min−1, raised to 160°C at 3°C  min−1, and to 240°C at 10°C min−1, holding for 3 min. After a 12-min  solvent delay, mass spectra were recorded using a scanning range of 50–750  m/z at 20 scans per second. Chromatograms were analysed with MassHunter  Workstation software version B.08.00 (Agilent), and STPs were identified  using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library  (Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Further identification was conducted with  purified standard calibration curves ranging from concentrations of  1–1,200 μM in dodecane of δ-guaiene (CAT#B942760), patchoulol  (CAT#P206200), santalene (CAT#S15065), valerianol (CAT#V914000, Toronto  Research Chemicals, ON, Canada), bisabolol (CAT#95426), valencene  (CAT#06808), cedrene (CAT#22133, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) (Supplementary  Fig. 6). For compound identification, retention-time acquisition, internal  digital-library calibration, and method development, we used a set of 12  microampules containing a standard terpene mixture, which covered 98  terpenes at 1 mM in methanol (CAT# MSITPN101, MetaSci, ON, Canada,  Supplementary Table 4). Two-dimensional Gas chromatography time-of-flight  mass spectrometry (GCxGC–TOF/MS) analysis Comprehensive two-dimensional  gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC–TOF/MS)  analysis of agarwood and distillate extracts in acetone was performed  using an Agilent 7890B gas-chromatography system equipped with a Zoex ZX1  cryogenic thermal modulator and a JEOL TOF MS (AccuTOF GCx-plus, JEOL,  Japan). The GCxGC system featured a normal (non-polar x mid-polar)  two-dimensional column configuration, comprising a first-dimension column  with a 30 m non-polar HP-5MS UI capillary column  (5%-phenyl-methylpolysiloxane) and a second-dimension column with a 2 m  mid-polar BPX-50 capillary column (50% phenyl polysilphenylene-siloxane).  We used helium (99.999%) as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 0.8  mL min−1. The GCxGC–TOF/MS injector temperature was maintained at 300°C  with a 10:1 split ratio. The oven temperature was initially held at 80°C  for 1 min, then increased to 325°C at 2°C min−1. The modulation period was  set at 6 s with a pulse time of 0.35 ms. The mass spectrometer operated in  electron ionisation (EI+) mode at 70 eV. Both the transfer-line and  ion-source temperatures were maintained at 250°C. The detector voltage of  TOF was set to 2,500 Volts, and data were acquired at a rate of 50 Hz.  Mass spectra were obtained within a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) from 50 to  600. Gas chromatography data analysis The analysis of terpenoid extracts  followed a procedure similar to previously reported methods, and  qualitative analyses primarily relied on the retention index and match  factor. The GC–MS/FID data were processed using the MassHunter Workstation  software version B.08.00 (Agilent Technologies, USA). The identification  of compounds was assisted by the NIST Mass Spectral Library Version 2.3  (National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).  The mass-spectral data, derived from the GCxGC–TOF/MS analysis, were  evaluated with GC ImageTM Version 2.9 software (Lincoln, NE, USA) and  referenced against the NIST2020/EPA/NIH EI Mass Spectral Library. The  spectral data were cross-referenced with library spectra to identify  potential chemical structures, facilitated by calculating the match factor  and probability, thereby generating a list of probable compound matches.  The match factor directly compares the unknown mass spectrum peaks with  those in the library spectra, indicating their similarity. In contrast,  the probability determines the relative likelihood of the list of hits  being accurate, assuming that the unknown spectrum is present in the  library. Using these metrics provides the relative assuredness of matching  chemical structures within the library spectra. Sesquiterpenoid production  and concentration Transformants of best-performing STPS isoforms that  accumulated the most of each heterologous sesquiterpenoid in screening  conditions, were subjected to solvent–culture two-phase cultivations at  300 mL scale in TAPhi-NO3 medium using FC-3283 as a solvent underlay  phase, as previously described. FC-3283 is a perfluorinated amine that is  inert and denser than water, forming an underlay to the culture and  accumulating heterologous terpene products from the algae. After 6 days of  cultivation, gravity and gentle centrifugation separated the fluorocarbon  and cultures. After centrifugation to clarify, fluorocarbons were  subjected to liquid–liquid extraction to partition accumulated STPs into  an equal volume of 96% ethanol. The mixture was shaken for 16 h at room  temperature at 200 rpm. Next, samples were again centrifuged gently to  further separate the phases. FC-3283, after ethanol extraction, can be  reused on algal cultures and is effectively recycled in this process. 500  μL aliquots from each phase were sampled and stored in separate GC vials  at –20°C for subsequent analysis and separation performance  quantification. For each of the nine STPs biosynthesised by the algae, 20  mL 96% ethanol-containing STOs were generated. The ethanol fractions were  pooled and subjected to organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) in a dead-end  cell to concentrate the terpenes in ethanol without evaporative losses. A  Duramem solvent-resistant membrane (Evonik, Germany) with a nominal  molecular weight cut-off value of 300 g mol–1 suitable for STP retention  and chemical compatibility with ethanol was selected. The 200 mL  ethanol–sesquiterpenoid mixture was loaded into the OSN chamber containing  a 16 mm membrane disc and subjected to 20 bar pressure delivered by CO2 as  an inert gas, to drive the ethanol phase through the nanofiltration  membrane at 2.84 L m–2 h–1 flux. While ethanol permeated the membrane,  STPs were kept in the retentate due to their molecular weight and  consequently concentrated in the ethanol. The permeate ethanol is suitable  for recycling and can be reused in subsequent liquid–liquid extraction  processes. Bulk hydroxylation of sesquiterpenoid backbones To selectively  introduce hydroxyl groups at the double bonds present in the terpenes,  hydroboration-oxidation reactions were performed using two distinct  organoboron reagents: borane–tetrahydrofuran complex (BH3·THF)  (CAT#176192, Sigma-Aldrich) and 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (151076,  Sigma-Aldrich). Three different stoichiometric ratios (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0)  were explored for each reagent to investigate different degrees of  hydroxylation within the STP mixture. The sterically hindered 9-BBN was  anticipated to selectively react with the least sterically demanding sites  of the terpenes, while the borane–tetrahydrofuran complex was expected to  facilitate hydroxylation even at the more challenging endocyclic  positions. To remove residual ethanol and water content from the  concentrated terpene mixture, a rotary evaporator was used under reduced  pressure at 40°C, ensuring effective removal without compromising the  integrity of the terpenes. To ensure the complete removal of water,  molecular sieves (CAT#105734, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the terpene–THF  solvent mixture. The reactions were carried out in anhydrous  tetrahydrofuran (THF, Sigma-Aldrich) to enable removal by evaporation  after completion. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%, VWR Chemicals) and sodium  hydroxide aqueous solution (NaOH, Sigma-Aldrich) were used to convert the  organoboron intermediates into non-toxic, water-soluble boric acid after  the reaction. All subsequent terpene derivatives were extracted from the  aqueous mixture with ethyl acetate. Data analysis To evaluate the impact  of engineered modifications on STP biosynthesis and growth characteristics  in C. reinhardtii strains, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was  performed to compare mean STP (patchoulol) titres and growth rates among  different transformants and the parental control strain. This statistical  approach allowed for the simultaneous analysis of differences between  multiple groups, to provide a robust assessment of the experimental  manipulations. ANOVAs were performed separately for STP titres and growth  rates under mixotrophic and phototrophic conditions. Post-hoc pairwise  comparisons using Tukey's HSD were conducted to identify which groups  were statistically significantly different. A one-way ANOVA was used to  assess the effects of differences in STP biosynthesis among tested  strategies (single or double transformation), followed by a post hoc  Tukey's HSD test for specific pairwise data-set comparisons. Mean  production values (in fg cell–1 and mg L–1) for each STP were compared,  considering standard deviations to evaluate data variability. Mean values  were considered statistically significantly different at a level of p  &lt; 0.05. For data analyses, JMP v.16 (SAS Institute Inc, NC, USA)  and Rstudio 3.6.2 (Posit Software, Boston, USA) were used. Data  visualisation was done using JMP v.16 and GraphPad Prism v.10 (GraphPad  Software, MA, USA). Image adjustments involved ColourChecker calibration  (Calibrite LLC, DE, USA) paired with Adobe Lightroom (Adobe Inc., CA, USA)  for colour accuracy. The Gardner Colour Scale was used for agarwood sample  assessment. Images were cropped and organised in Affinity Photo v.1.10.6  (Serif Ltd., WB, UK). Analysis of images and assignment of colour values  according to the Gardner scale was conducted using ImageJ software (NIH,  USA). Diagrams and illustrations were made using Affinity Designer  v.1.10.6 (Serif Ltd., WB, UK), chemical structures with ChemDraw v.20.1  (PerkinElmer, MA, USA) and all visual elements were harmonised in Affinity  Publisher v.1.10.6 (Serif Ltd., WB, UK).",,Gas chromatography;Terpenes;FOS: Biological sciences;Mass spectra;Environmental chemistry;Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry;sesquiterpenoids;GCxGC TOF MS;Pollution;Agarwood,Terpenes,,OpenAIRE,"{coordinates:[0.0,0.0],type:point}",https://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h70rxwdq5;http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h70rxwdq5,,,,,2025-02-18 17:43:20,2024-01-18,0001-01-01 00:00:00,['none'],['none'],['none'],['none'],[],"['Gutiérrez, Sergio', 'Overmans, Sebastian', 'Wellman, Gordon', 'Samaras, Valisios G.', 'Oviedo, Claudia', 'Gede, Martin', 'Szekely, Gyorgy', 'Lauersen, Kyle J.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],gravity core analysis

Data is presented for 296 samples, consisting of Uvigerina peregrina (222 samples), Uvigerina mediterranea (7 samples) and Melonis barleeanus (67 samples). 15 duplicate samples (indicated in column 15 \Duplicates\) are included. Sediment samples came from both previously washed, and fresh; mud Fresh samples were washed using deionized water through a 63 µm sieve, dried at 45°C for less than 24 hours, and dry sieved. Benthic foraminifera were picked from the >150 µm fraction. Selected samples were weighed on a microbalance, and to avoid calibration problems, samples with weights over 400 µm were split into smaller sample sizes (\Splitted Sample\ in the dataset), and the estimated new weight was calculated using the average specimen weight of each samples and multiplying it by the total specimens picked for analyses (\Estimate test mass used\ in the data set). For duplicates, an equal number of specimens was crushed separately for the original and duplicate measurement. If weighed, each portion was assumed to have half the mass of the total sample. In general, between 3 and 11 specimens were used for U. peregrina and between 10 and 16 specimens for M. barleeanus. Before analysis, foraminifera samples were crushed and cleaned with water, methanol and hot buffered hydrogen peroxide with no reductive cleaning step (Johnstone et al., 2016). Samples were measured using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES)—Agilent Technologies 700 Series with Cetac ASX-520 autosampler at the following spectral lines: Ca (315.9 nm), Mg (279.6 nm), Sr (421.6), Fe (238.2 nm), and Mn (257.6 nm), Ba (455.4 nm) and Al (167.0 nm) calibrated using linear regressions. Calibration standards consisted of a blank and five multi-element standards of between 20 and 100 ppm Ca. Instrumental precision was monitored by using a commercial multi-element standard solution (SCP, France), and commercial powder sample ECRM752-1. Theoretical value (measured value, σ standard deviation, standard error) in mmol/mol for the SCP standard during these runs were: Mg/Ca, 2.955 (2.959, σ 0.030, 0.0029), Sr/Ca, 1.402 (1.402, 0. σ 016, 0.0015), Mn/Ca 0.3234 (0.3291, σ 0.0019, 0.00019), Fe/Ca, 0.3312 (0.3228, σ 0.0034, 0.00033), Ba/Ca, 0.00832 (0.00840,  0.00034, 0.000033) and Al/Ca 0.678 (0.695, σ 0.018, 0.0018), n=108. Mg/Ca of dissolved, centrifuged, ECRM 752-1 (measured at 3.750 σ 0.015, 0.0014 by Greaves et al. (2005)) was 3.735 σ 0.031, 0.0057.

The WC was also measured at 1 cm interval using 1 cm thick subsamples by calculating the following equation with an assumption of 35 psu for the salinity of seawater:WC (%) = (mass of wet sediment - (mass of dry sediment+mass of salt))/(mass of wet sediment × 100).The grain size was measured at 4 cm intervals. After removing organic matter using 10% H2O2 and biogenic silica using 2N NaOH, the coarse fraction (&gt;63 μm) was analyzed using 1 phi interval sieves. In contrast, the fine fraction (&lt;63 μm) was analyzed using Micrometrics Sedigraph III 5120. The grain size classification followed the scheme of Folk and Ward (1957).The Total Carbon (TC) and Total Nitrogen (TN) contents were analyzed using an elemental analyzer (FLASH 2000 NC Analyzer) with an analytical precision of less than 0.1%. Total Inorganic Carbon (TIC) was measured using UIC CO2 coulometer (Model CM5240). CaCO3 concentration was calculated by multiplying TIC content by 8.333 (i.e., the ratio of CaCO3 and carbon). TOC content was calculated as the difference between TC and TIC contents.Biogenic silica concentration was measured at 8 cm intervals (GC01, GC04, and GC05) and 4 cm intervals (GC02) using the wet alkaline sequential extraction method using 1N NaOH solution at 85˚C modified from DeMaster (1981) at Pusan National University. Biogenic opal content was calculated by multiplying biogenic silica concentrations by 2.4 (i.e., the ratio of biogenic opal and Si) (Mortlock and Froelich, 1989). The analytical precision for the biogenic opal measurement was ±1%.The carbon isotope composition (δ13CSOM) of the sediment organic matter was measured for selected sediment samples at 10 cm intervals from GC01 and at 8 or 16 cm intervals from GC02, 04, and 05 using elemental analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS: Europa Scientific 20-20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer) at Iso-Analytical Ltd.
