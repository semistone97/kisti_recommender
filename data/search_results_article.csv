The diagnosis and treatment of this disease is a vital importance. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown a good performance in learning the high-level features and in resolving segmentation issues. In this paper, we propose a new model of DL 3D-Res-UNet in order to accurately segment the knee cartilage from a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3D construction that allows perfectly visualizing the anatomical structure of this organ. This model is a combination of an architecture widely known in the literature for its segmentation efficiency (3D-UNet) with a residual architecture (3D-ResNet). The experimental results reveal that the suggested model can stabilize the training model, segment the cartilage from MRI very well and compete with the state of art on multiple performance metrics. The gain of precision and recall with 3DRes-UNet is given up to 15% and 26% compared to 3D-ResNet and 3D-UNet, respectively, hence the effectiveness of the suggested method.</P>","Hedi Bedoui, Mohamed",2,1,pp.1-7,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13614853,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13614853&type=mobile,,,3D knee model

In this study, we constructed a SSM database using 152 human computed tomography (CT) knee joint models, including the femur, tibia and patella and analysed the characteristics of each principal component of the SSM. The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation). The computational time for each bone of the knee joint was within 30?s using a personal computer. The analysis of this study indicated that the SSM method could be a useful tool to construct 3D surface models of the knee with sub-millimeter accuracy in real time.

This method is a first step towards automation of prosthesis placement. Thanks to the mathematically computed four-bar mechanism, it is now possible to emulate the implant insertion before the operation. This model allows the surgeon to fit the prosthesis to the patient&#x2019;s knee and to verify if the mounted position is optimal. This process can be repeated until the ideal position is found. Exact copies of the bones are made from the CT images of the patient. These resin copies of the real bones are placed in the motion model, reproducing the real patient&#x2019;s knee flexion. The model shows the implantation result with respect to the operation plan and the patient&#x2019;s kinematics. The experiment carried out on a patient&#x2019;s model according to the standard implantation shows a lift-off and sliding effect of the femoral component outside the joint area. However, this phenomenon is easily resolved if the femoral component is implanted about half a centimeter lateral to the knee&#x2019;s coronal axis. Until now, no medical research had questioned the lateral positioning of the prosthesis. This knee model provides an understanding of the important biomechanical parameters for total knee replacement surgery. This model will have a significant contribution to secure the surgery&#x2019;s success, increase patient satisfaction and reduce the overall number of revisions.</P>","Rottinger, Timon;Rottinger, Heinz;",2,1,pp.12501-12507,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13526087,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13526087&type=mobile,,,3D knee model

However, many clinical problems occur in knee joints of Korean patients after total knee joint replacement owing to the geometric mismatch between the western implants and Korean knee joint structures. To solve these problems, a method to determine the representative dimension parameter values of Korean knee joints is introduced to aid in the design of knee joint implants appropriate for Korean patients. Measurements of the dimension parameters of 88 male Korean knee joint subjects were carried out. The distribution of the subjects versus each measured parameter value was investigated. The measured dimension parameter values of each parameter were grouped by suitable intervals called the &ldquo;size group,&rdquo; and average values of the size groups were calculated. The knee joint subjects were grouped as the &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; based on &ldquo;size group numbers&rdquo; of each parameter. From the iterative calculations to decrease the errors between the average dimension parameter values of each &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; and the dimension parameter values of the subjects, the average dimension parameter values that give less than the error criterion were determined to be the representative dimension parameter values for designing knee joint implants for Korean patients. </P>","Kwak, Dai Soon;Tao, Quang Bang;Todo, Mitsugu;Jeon, Insu;",2,1,pp.368-376,https://doi.org/10.1177/0954411912442025,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART73608690,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART73608690&type=mobile,,,Korean knee joint

The subjects were divided into young, middle and old age group respectively for the male and female; and articular cartilage thickness using MRI were measured. RESULT: Each of the three groups reveals the tendency of decrease in the thickness of the knee joint cartilage in all of the age groups along with the increase of the age. The cartilage thickness according to age for both sex, except for the tibial medial condyle, decreased significantly. For the male subjects, the degree of decrease in cartilage thicknes indicates difference in each sections.

Although many devices exist for joints kinematics assessment, there is a need for a system that could be used in routine practice. Such a system should be accurate, ambulatory, and easy to use. The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics (ISB). A simple method based on a leg movement is proposed here to align two inertial measurement units fixed on the thigh and shank segments. Based on the combination of the former alignment and a fusion algorithm, the three-dimensional knee joint angle is measured and compared with a magnetic motion capture system during walking. The proposed system is suitable to measure the absolute knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction angles with mean (SD) offset errors of -1<SUP>o</SUP> (1<SUP>o</SUP>) and 0<SUP>o</SUP> (0.6<SUP>o</SUP>) and mean (SD) root mean square (RMS) errors of 1.5<SUP>o</SUP> (0.4<SUP>o</SUP>) and 1.7<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The system is also suitable for the relative measurement of knee internal/external rotation (mean (SD) offset error of 3.4<SUP>o</SUP> (2.7<SUP>o</SUP>)) with a mean (SD) RMS error of 1.6<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>).

During knee arthroscopy, the patient's leg position is continuously adjusted to create the space for surgical instruments inside the joint. Surgeons 'feel' the force they apply to the leg and estimate the joint space from a 2D video. In many cases, they overestimate the instrument gap, resulting in damaging to the knee joint by pushing instruments through a gap that is too small. We used cadaveric experiments to inform the noise induced by the sensors and image processing steps, to derive an error point-cloud in a simulated environment. From the point-cloud, we calculate the instrument gap range inside the knee joint. For a selected surgical instrument gap size, the measurement algorithm is accurate to less than a millimetre.

However, the calcified cartilage, the subchondral bone plate, and trabecular subchondral bone that are mineralized tissues strongly attenuate X-rays and are therefore potentially accessible for analyses using computed tomography (CT). CT images nicely show osseous cardinal signs of advanced osteoarthritis such as osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and subchondral bone sclerosis. But more importantly, CT can help us to better understand the pathophysiology of knee osteoarthritis from the measurement of the density and structure of subchondral mineralized tissues in vivo. For that purpose, we recently developed dedicated image analysis software called Medical Image Analysis Framework (MIAF)-Knee. In this manuscript, our aims are to present current knowledge on CT imaging of the subchondral bone in knee osteoarthritis and to provide a brief introduction to basic technical aspects of MIAF-Knee as well as preliminary results we obtained in patients with knee osteoarthritis as compared to control subjects.</P>","Bousson, V.;Lowitz, T.;Laouisset, L.;Engelke, K.;Laredo, J.-D.;",2,1,pp.861-865,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-012-2169-5,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART65127795,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART65127795&type=mobile,,,CT knee imaging

In this work, we present a novel DL framework, grounded in the development of the Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) method, tailored specifically for the synthesis of pseudo-CT images in knee imaging to surmount the limitations of current methods. Upon visually examining the outcomes, it is evident that the synthesized pseudo-CTs show an excellent quality and high robustness. Despite the limited dataset employed, the method is able to capture the particularities of the bone contours in the resulting image. The experimental Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Zero-Normalized Cross Correlation (ZNCC), Mutual Information (MI), Relative Change (RC), and absolute Relative Change (|RC|) report values of 30.4638 ± 7.4770, 28.1168 ± 1.5245, 0.9230 ± 0.0217, 0.9807 ± 0.0071, 0.8548 ± 0.1019, 0.0055 ± 0.0265, and 0.0302 ± 0.0218 (median ± median absolute deviation), respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cuboid (3- or 6-mm-long sides) osseous and cartilaginous bodies were implanted in 16 cadaveric knee specimens. MR imaging was performed with T1-weighted spin-echo (SE), T2-weighted SE, proton-density-weighted SE, gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS), and spoiled GRASS sequences. MR arthrography was performed in two phases with saline and 2 mmol/L gadopentetate dimeglumine. CT and CT arthrography were performed in the transaxial plane. RESULTS: MR arthrography yielded the highest accuracy for the detection of osseous and cartilaginous bodies combined (92%) and was significantly (P < .01) better than MR imaging (57%-70%), CT arthrography (80%), and CT (74%). Accuracy of CT arthrography was significantly better than that of MR imaging and that of CT. Accuracy of saline-enhanced MR arthrography was significantly inferior (P < .001) to that of gadolinium-enhanced MR arthrography. CONCLUSION: MR arthrography is the best imaging technique for detection of individual intraarticular bodies. CT arthrography is the second most accurate method. Spoiled GRASS and T2-weighted SE sequences are the most accurate at MR imaging. The presence of intraarticular fluid and performance of saline-enhanced MR arthrography improve detectability of intraarticular bodies.</P>","Brossmann, J;Preidler, K W;Daenen, B;Pedowitz, R A;Andresen, R;Clopton, P;Trudell, D;Pathria, M;Resnick, D;",2,1,pp.509-517,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART00528448,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART00528448&type=mobile,,,CT knee imaging

Despite its importance, this process currently lacks automation. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to automate implant size prediction.Methods A total of 13,281 (2938 anteroposterior, 10,343 lateral) knee radiographs obtained from the authors’ institute were utilized for model training, with 2302 (1034 anteroposterior, 1268 lateral) images set apart for validation and testing.The templating AI model integrates a pipeline composed of multiple steps for automated implant size estimation.To predict implant size, anterioposterior (AP) and lateral radiograph predictions were merged, selecting the smaller of the predicted sizes to prevent implant overhang. The model’s size predictions were validated with 81 real TKA data set apart from the training data, and its accuracy was compared to that of manual templating by an orthopedic specialist. Predictions matching the actual implanted sizes were labeled “exact” and those within one size, “accurate.” The influence of patient characteristics on the model’s prediction accuracy was also analyzed. The measurement time elapsed for implant sizing was recorded for both the AI model and the orthopedic specialist. Implant position predicted by the model was validated by comparing insert locations with postoperative images.Results Compared with data from 81 actual TKA procedures, the model provided exact predictions for 39.5% of femoral and 43.2% of tibial components. Allowing a one-size margin of error, 88.9% of predictions were deemed “accurate” for both components. Interobserver reliability (Cohen’s kappa) were 0.60 and 0.70 for femoral and tibial implants, respectively, both classified as “substantial.” The orthopedic specialist produced results accurate within one-size margin of error in 95.1% and 100% of cases for femoral and tibial components, respectively. Interobserver reliability between the orthopedic specialist and ground truth was 0.76 and 0.8 for femoral and tibial components, respectively.The measurement time per case was 48.7 s for the AI model, compared with 97.5 s for the orthopedic specialist. Compared with postoperative radiographs, predicted implant position had an error of less than 4 mm on average.Conclusions An AI-based templating tool for TKA was successfully developed, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. Its application could significantly reduce the clinical workload in TKA preparation.","Jaeseok Park;Sung Eun Kim;Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Seoul National University Hospital);Back Kim;Sanggyu Lee;Jae-Jun Lee;Du Hyun Ro;",0,0,pp.38-38,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s43019-024-00240-7,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003211058,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003211058,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003211058&type=mobile,,,knee arthroplasty model

We conducted a retrospective cohort study by collecting all revision cases available (n &#x003D; 1) and randomly selecting 74 UKA cases to keep the revision prevalence of almost 14&#x0025;. The finite element method was first applied to calculate the strain biomechanical features. We then simulated strains of each tissue node induced by the contact force during gait for five movement points through the stance phase of walking. The biological factors such as C-reactive protein and patient&#x2019;s behaviors such as pre- and post-operative maximum strains change during gait, body mass index (BMI), and age were combined and analyzed with the kernel least mean square (KLMS) method. These data were used to model the relationships among the biomechanical, biological factor, and patient&#x2019;s behaviors to predict the risk of UKA revision. The five-fold cross-validation was conducted to assess the prediction accuracy. As a result, the average prediction accuracy for correctly predicting UKA revision was 90.69&#x0025; for all cases, providing substantial evidence that this model can serve as a potential tool in decision-making for UKA surgical planning.

In vivo peak forces ranged from 2.2 to 2.3 times bodyweight but peaked at different flexion angles based on the type of squatting activity. Our model predicted tibiofemoral contact force with reasonable accuracy in both subjects.
