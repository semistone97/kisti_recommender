The diagnosis and treatment of this disease is a vital importance. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) approaches have shown a good performance in learning the high-level features and in resolving segmentation issues. In this paper, we propose a new model of DL 3D-Res-UNet in order to accurately segment the knee cartilage from a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 3D construction that allows perfectly visualizing the anatomical structure of this organ. This model is a combination of an architecture widely known in the literature for its segmentation efficiency (3D-UNet) with a residual architecture (3D-ResNet). The experimental results reveal that the suggested model can stabilize the training model, segment the cartilage from MRI very well and compete with the state of art on multiple performance metrics. The gain of precision and recall with 3DRes-UNet is given up to 15% and 26% compared to 3D-ResNet and 3D-UNet, respectively, hence the effectiveness of the suggested method.</P>","Hedi Bedoui, Mohamed",2,1,pp.1-7,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13614853,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13614853&type=mobile,,,3D knee model

In this study, we constructed a SSM database using 152 human computed tomography (CT) knee joint models, including the femur, tibia and patella and analysed the characteristics of each principal component of the SSM. The surface models of two in vivo knees were predicted using the SSM and their 2D bi-plane fluoroscopic images. The predicted models were compared to their CT joint models. The differences between the predicted 3D knee joint surfaces and the CT image-based surfaces were 0.30??0.81?mm, 0.34??0.79?mm and 0.36??0.59?mm for the femur, tibia and patella, respectively (average??standard deviation). The computational time for each bone of the knee joint was within 30?s using a personal computer. The analysis of this study indicated that the SSM method could be a useful tool to construct 3D surface models of the knee with sub-millimeter accuracy in real time.

This method is a first step towards automation of prosthesis placement. Thanks to the mathematically computed four-bar mechanism, it is now possible to emulate the implant insertion before the operation. This model allows the surgeon to fit the prosthesis to the patient&#x2019;s knee and to verify if the mounted position is optimal. This process can be repeated until the ideal position is found. Exact copies of the bones are made from the CT images of the patient. These resin copies of the real bones are placed in the motion model, reproducing the real patient&#x2019;s knee flexion. The model shows the implantation result with respect to the operation plan and the patient&#x2019;s kinematics. The experiment carried out on a patient&#x2019;s model according to the standard implantation shows a lift-off and sliding effect of the femoral component outside the joint area. However, this phenomenon is easily resolved if the femoral component is implanted about half a centimeter lateral to the knee&#x2019;s coronal axis. Until now, no medical research had questioned the lateral positioning of the prosthesis. This knee model provides an understanding of the important biomechanical parameters for total knee replacement surgery. This model will have a significant contribution to secure the surgery&#x2019;s success, increase patient satisfaction and reduce the overall number of revisions.</P>","Rottinger, Timon;Rottinger, Heinz;",2,1,pp.12501-12507,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13526087,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13526087&type=mobile,,,3D knee model

However, when implementing these measurements across multiple clinical centers, scanner variability becomes a critical consideration. Our purposes were to quantify and compare same-model variability (between repeated scans on the same MRI system) and cross-model variability (across different MRI systems) in knee cartilage thickness measurements using MRI scanners from five manufacturers, as analyzed with a specific 3D volume analysis software.</P></P><P>Methods<P>Ten healthy volunteers (eight males and two females, aged 22-60 years) underwent two scans of their right knee on 3T MRI systems from five manufacturers (Canon, Fujifilm, GE, Philips, and Siemens). The imaging protocol included fat-suppressed spoiled gradient echo and proton density weighted sequences.

In this study, a total of 52 patients who need knee replacement were selected as the study objects, and 52 patients were divided into experimental group and control group. First, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA), lateral femoral angle (LFA), hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), femorotibial angle (FTA) of research objects in both groups were measured. Then, the blood loss during the operations, drainage volume after operations, total blood loss, hidden blood loss, and hemoglobin decrease of the experiment group and the control group were measured and calculated. Finally, the postoperative outcomes of patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty were evaluated. The results showed that before the operations, in the PSI group, the femoral mechanical-anatomical angle (FMAA) was (6.9 &plusmn; 2.4)&deg;, the lateral femoral angle (LFA) was (82.4 &plusmn; 1.6)&deg;, the hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA) was (166.4 &plusmn; 1.4)&deg;, and the femorotibial angle (FTA) was (179.5 &plusmn; 7.3)&deg;.

The differences in these data between the two groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). After the operations, in the PSI group, the total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, and the hemoglobin (Hb) decrease were respectively (420.2 &plusmn; 210.5), (240.5 &plusmn; 234.5), and (1.7 &plusmn; 0.9); in the CON group, the total blood loss, the hidden blood loss, and the Hb decrease were respectively (782.1 &plusmn; 340.4), (450.9 &plusmn; 352.6), and (2.9 &plusmn; 1.0).

Objectives: The graphical modeling approach comes in two parts. The first is the segmentation of MRI scanned images, retrieved in DICOM format for edge detection.

The finite element analysis is done by first extracting the prosthetic implants from the reconstructed 3D-CAD model, then do a finite element analysis of these implants under objectively determined conditions such as; forces, allowed displacements, the materials composing implant, and the coefficient of friction.

However, many clinical problems occur in knee joints of Korean patients after total knee joint replacement owing to the geometric mismatch between the western implants and Korean knee joint structures. To solve these problems, a method to determine the representative dimension parameter values of Korean knee joints is introduced to aid in the design of knee joint implants appropriate for Korean patients. Measurements of the dimension parameters of 88 male Korean knee joint subjects were carried out. The distribution of the subjects versus each measured parameter value was investigated. The measured dimension parameter values of each parameter were grouped by suitable intervals called the &ldquo;size group,&rdquo; and average values of the size groups were calculated. The knee joint subjects were grouped as the &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; based on &ldquo;size group numbers&rdquo; of each parameter. From the iterative calculations to decrease the errors between the average dimension parameter values of each &ldquo;patient group&rdquo; and the dimension parameter values of the subjects, the average dimension parameter values that give less than the error criterion were determined to be the representative dimension parameter values for designing knee joint implants for Korean patients. </P>","Kwak, Dai Soon;Tao, Quang Bang;Todo, Mitsugu;Jeon, Insu;",2,1,pp.368-376,https://doi.org/10.1177/0954411912442025,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART73608690,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART73608690&type=mobile,,,Korean knee joint

However, there are still some controversies in the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL. The purpose of this study was to investigate anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the ALL using Korean cadaveric knee joints. We investigated the effect of ALL injury on its footprint distances under various knee conditions and assessed three-dimensional functional stability tests (pivot-shift and Lachmann tests) using a noninvasive triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Materials and Methods&amp;#xD; 20 fresh-frozen cadaveric knees were dissected by a single surgeon. The locations of the tibial and femoral footprints of the ALL were recorded with respect to the lateral femoral epicondyle, tip of the fibular head, and Gerdy’s tubercle. The distance between the footprints were recorded in a normal knee condition. All cadavers were tested in neutral, internal, and external rotation at 30°, 60°, 90° of knee flexion. The pivot shift and Lachmann tests were measured using a triaxial accelerometer device (KiRA). Serial sectioning of the ALL and the ACL was performed after testing in normal knee joints. Measurements were collected before and after each sectioning.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Results&amp;#xD; Anatomical features of the current study were similar to those of previous cadaveric studies. The prevalence of the ALL in our study was 100%. Average distance of the tibial footprint to the tip of the fibular head was 19.85 ± 3.41 mm and to Gerdy’s tubercle was 18.3 ± 4.19mm. Average distance of the femoral footprint to the lateral femoral epicondyle was 10.25 ± 2.97mm. The footprint distance of the ALL was the longest at 30° of knee flexion (47.83 ± 8.05 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001) in a normal knee neutral rotation condition. An internal rotational force produced statistically significant increases in footprint distances in normal knees at all three knee flexion angles. During internal rotation, the footprint distance was also the longest at 30° of knee flexion (50.05 ± 8.88 mm, p&amp;lt;0.001). Although an internal rotational force did not produce a statistically significant increase in the footprint distance after ALL transection, it increased the footprint distance at all three knee flexion angles after a combined ACL and ALL transection (p = 0.022). After a combined ACL and ALL transection, the footprint distance was the longest at 30° of knee flexion under internal rotational force (52.05 ± 7.60 mm). Pivot shift and Lachmann tests measured by the KiRA device did not show statistically significant differences between normal and ALL-transected knees. However, there were significant differences in the combined ACL-ALL-transected knees compared with normal and ALL-transected knees (p&amp;lt;0.001).&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Conclusion&amp;#xD; The ALL was identified as a distinct ligament structure in this Korean cadaveric study. Considering the footprint distances of the ALL in various knee conditions, the ALL is thought to play a protective role in internal rotational stability especially at 30° of knee flexion. Isolated ALL transection did not show significant effects on the ALL footprint distances and functional stability tests. The ALL is thought to act as a secondary supportive stabilizer for rotational stability of the knee joint in conjunction with the ACL.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; Keywords: knee joint, anterolateral ligament, anterior cruciate ligament, rotatory instability, KiRA, anterolateral ligament reconstruction, Korean cadaver&amp;#xD;",서대근,0,0,"iv, 33장",,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0016389705,,Anterior cruciate ligament Anterolateral ligament Rotatory instability Anterolateral ligament reconstruction Korean cadaver Knee joint;,국내박사,Korean knee joint

Knees of ≥KL grade 2 were classified as radiologic OA. The severity of joint space narrowing (JSN) was classified by X-rays as normal, mild-to-moderate, and severe JSN in radiologic OA. The subjects were grouped as normal SMI (SMI of ≥–1 standard deviation [SD] of the mean), low SMI class I (SMI of ≥–2 SDs and <–1 SD), and low SMI class II (SMI of <–2 SDs). Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) of ≥27.5 kg/m2.Results: The modified KL grade and JSN severity were negatively correlated with the SMI and positively correlated with BMI and age. The SMI was negatively correlated with age. JSN severity was significantly associated with a low SMI class compared to a normal SMI, which was more prominent in low SMI class II than class I. Obesity was significantly associated with more severe JSN, only for obesity with a low SMI class. Furthermore, patients with a low SMI class, regardless of obesity, were prone to having more severe JSN.Conclusion: This study suggested that a low SMI class was associated with aging and that an age-related low SMI was more critically related to the severity of JSN in OA.",김현제;Young Hoon Hong;,0,0,pp.285-293,http://dx.doi.org/10.12701/jyms.2021.01536,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002891276,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002891276&type=mobile,,,Korean knee joint

Methods : This is an observational study. 65 patients admitted to Daejeon Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine with musculoskeletal disorders were observed from July, 2014 to July, 2015. They were analyzed according to sex, age, pain lesion, body mass index(BMI) and treatment efficacy. All patients received a combination of treatments during hospitalization, including acupuncture, pharmacopuncture, herbal medicines and physical therapy. A zero to ten numerating rating scale (NRS) assessing pain, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index(WOMAC) index and Range of Motion(ROM) was used before and after treatments. Statistical correlations among assessment measurements were evaluated by examining the paired t-test and the Pearson's correlation coefficients. Results : The average BMI of all patients was <TEX>$24.03{\pm}2.95kg/m^2$</TEX>. According to clinical definition of obesity by Korean Society for the Study of Obesity, 33.8% of all patients was within normal weight, 1.5% was underweight, 33.8% was overweight, 24.6% was obesity and 6.2% was morbid obesity. For knee pain patients, NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) decreased from <TEX>$6.28{\pm}1.63$</TEX> to <TEX>$3.94{\pm}2.03$</TEX>(p<0.001).

Although many devices exist for joints kinematics assessment, there is a need for a system that could be used in routine practice. Such a system should be accurate, ambulatory, and easy to use. The combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers (i.e., inertial measurement unit) has proven to be suitable for unrestrained measurement of orientation during a short period of time (i.e., few minutes). However, due to their inability to detect horizontal reference, inertial-based systems generally fail to measure differential orientation, a prerequisite for computing the three-dimentional knee joint angle recommended by the Internal Society of Biomechanics (ISB). A simple method based on a leg movement is proposed here to align two inertial measurement units fixed on the thigh and shank segments. Based on the combination of the former alignment and a fusion algorithm, the three-dimensional knee joint angle is measured and compared with a magnetic motion capture system during walking. The proposed system is suitable to measure the absolute knee flexion/extension and abduction/adduction angles with mean (SD) offset errors of -1<SUP>o</SUP> (1<SUP>o</SUP>) and 0<SUP>o</SUP> (0.6<SUP>o</SUP>) and mean (SD) root mean square (RMS) errors of 1.5<SUP>o</SUP> (0.4<SUP>o</SUP>) and 1.7<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>). The system is also suitable for the relative measurement of knee internal/external rotation (mean (SD) offset error of 3.4<SUP>o</SUP> (2.7<SUP>o</SUP>)) with a mean (SD) RMS error of 1.6<SUP>o</SUP> (0.5<SUP>o</SUP>).

Techniques to measure joint motion which can either approximate the motion to less than 6 DOF or fully measure the spatial motion are identified. These include electrical linkage methods, radiographic and video techniques, fluoroscopic techniques and electromagnetic devices. In those cases where the full spatial motion is measured, the data are available to describe the motion in simpler terms (or with less DOF) than three rotations with three translations.

During knee arthroscopy, the patient's leg position is continuously adjusted to create the space for surgical instruments inside the joint. Surgeons 'feel' the force they apply to the leg and estimate the joint space from a 2D video. In many cases, they overestimate the instrument gap, resulting in damaging to the knee joint by pushing instruments through a gap that is too small. We used cadaveric experiments to inform the noise induced by the sensors and image processing steps, to derive an error point-cloud in a simulated environment. From the point-cloud, we calculate the instrument gap range inside the knee joint. For a selected surgical instrument gap size, the measurement algorithm is accurate to less than a millimetre. However, measurement errors introduce an uncertainty of 14%. The performance of our algorithms demonstrates the use of a single-lens arthroscope to measure the instrument gap to provide feedback to a surgeon or enable control of a robotic leg manipulator.</P>","Strydom, Mario;Crawford, Ross;Roberts, Jonathan;Jaiprakash, Anjali;",2,1,pp.168382-168394,https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2019.2953471,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART99435822,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART99435822&type=mobile,,,knee joint measurement

A large number of studies have attempted to estimate forces around the knee during various activities. Several approaches have been used to relate knee kinematics and external forces to internal joint contact forces, the most popular being inverse dynamics, forward dynamics, and static body analyses. Knee forces have also been measured in vivo after knee arthroplasty, which serves as valuable validation of computational predictions. This review summarizes the results of published studies that measured knee forces for various activities. The efficacy of various methods to alter knee force distribution, such as gait modification, orthotics, walking aids, and custom treadmills are analyzed. Current gaps in our knowledge are identified and directions for future research in this area are outlined. </P>","D’Lima, Darryl D;Fregly, Benjamin J;Patil, Shantanu;Steklov, Nikolai;Colwell Jr, Clifford W;",2,1,pp.95-102,https://doi.org/10.1177/0954411911433372,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART88284404,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART88284404&type=mobile,,,knee joint measurement

Simulating the natural motion of the human knee in different terrains is useful for the design and performance assessment of the prosthetic knee. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to propose a four-bar knee joint measurement system which can simulate the natural knee motions to collect the kinetic parameters precisely and analyze the walking characteristics under different terrain conditions. METHODS: A low-cost four-bar knee joint mechanism was proposed and gait characteristics were assessed on level ground, ascending and descending stairs, and ascending and descending ramp. RESULTS: The initial knee flexion angle during stair ascent at heel strike is obviously larger than in other walking scenes. The stance phase accounts for 53% of a single gait cycle during stair descent, which is slightly lower than other walking scenarios. The period that both the hindfoot and forefoot contact the ground in ramp descent accounts for 18%, which is less than for the others. While the forefoot contacts the ground in ramp ascent, the maximum vertical ground reaction force of the forefoot occurs when the hindfoot and forefoot simultaneously contact the ground, whereas in other scenarios the forefoot contacts the ground solely. CONCLUSIONS: The four-bar knee joint can simulate the natural motion of the human knee accurately. The gait characteristics analysis of different walking scenarios indicated that the low-cost four-bar knee joint exoskeleton was suitable for human knee joint simulation.</P>","Zhang, Yibin;Cao, Wujing;Yu, Hongliu;Meng, Qiaoling;Lv, Jie;",2,1,pp.823-828,https://doi.org/10.3233/thc-202667,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART115988879,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART115988879&type=mobile,,,knee joint measurement

The measuring date of meniscus, anterior cruciate ligament, posterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament and the lateral collateral ligament were obtained and compared with the results of the cadaver published in the related anatomic literature. The regression relationship between the body of meniscus, the width of tibial plateau and the weight of volunteer were analyzed statistically. Of the volunteers, 13 were performed with T2WI and PDWI fat saturation sequence scan, analyzed and compared the advantage of the two sequences in demonstrating the meniscus and ligament. Results The values of menisci measured in MRI were larger than the corresponding values in cadaver reported literature. The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus was thicker than the others. There was linear regression among the width of medial meniscus body, the width of the tibial plateau, and the body weight. The angle between ACI. and Blumensaat＇s line was less than 15° The PCI. angle was （120.89±5.63）°.

To reconstruct the 3-dimensional (3D) position and orientation of bones from markers placed on body surface, the spatial relationship between anatomical frames and skin marker clusters needs to be identified [1]. Since the determination of anatomical landmark (AL) locations in general lacks accuracy and precision, anatomical frames defined based on ALs are subject to uncertainty. This is a major issue in human movement analysis and its effects on knee rotation kinematics determination have been studied [1]. However, few studies have investigated the effects of uncertainty of anatomical definition on translation measurement of knee join. Although knee translations are secondary motions with only small magnitudes, they are regarded with great clinical significance. On the other hand, translation measurement is more sensitive to definitions of origin positions in addition to axis directions of the anatomical frames.

However, the calcified cartilage, the subchondral bone plate, and trabecular subchondral bone that are mineralized tissues strongly attenuate X-rays and are therefore potentially accessible for analyses using computed tomography (CT). CT images nicely show osseous cardinal signs of advanced osteoarthritis such as osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and subchondral bone sclerosis. But more importantly, CT can help us to better understand the pathophysiology of knee osteoarthritis from the measurement of the density and structure of subchondral mineralized tissues in vivo. For that purpose, we recently developed dedicated image analysis software called Medical Image Analysis Framework (MIAF)-Knee. In this manuscript, our aims are to present current knowledge on CT imaging of the subchondral bone in knee osteoarthritis and to provide a brief introduction to basic technical aspects of MIAF-Knee as well as preliminary results we obtained in patients with knee osteoarthritis as compared to control subjects.</P>","Bousson, V.;Lowitz, T.;Laouisset, L.;Engelke, K.;Laredo, J.-D.;",2,1,pp.861-865,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-012-2169-5,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART65127795,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART65127795&type=mobile,,,CT knee imaging

In this work, we present a novel DL framework, grounded in the development of the Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) method, tailored specifically for the synthesis of pseudo-CT images in knee imaging to surmount the limitations of current methods. Upon visually examining the outcomes, it is evident that the synthesized pseudo-CTs show an excellent quality and high robustness. Despite the limited dataset employed, the method is able to capture the particularities of the bone contours in the resulting image.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cuboid (3- or 6-mm-long sides) osseous and cartilaginous bodies were implanted in 16 cadaveric knee specimens. MR imaging was performed with T1-weighted spin-echo (SE), T2-weighted SE, proton-density-weighted SE, gradient recalled acquisition in the steady state (GRASS), and spoiled GRASS sequences. MR arthrography was performed in two phases with saline and 2 mmol/L gadopentetate dimeglumine. CT and CT arthrography were performed in the transaxial plane. RESULTS: MR arthrography yielded the highest accuracy for the detection of osseous and cartilaginous bodies combined (92%) and was significantly (P < .01) better than MR imaging (57%-70%), CT arthrography (80%), and CT (74%). Accuracy of CT arthrography was significantly better than that of MR imaging and that of CT. Accuracy of saline-enhanced MR arthrography was significantly inferior (P < .001) to that of gadolinium-enhanced MR arthrography. CONCLUSION: MR arthrography is the best imaging technique for detection of individual intraarticular bodies. CT arthrography is the second most accurate method. Spoiled GRASS and T2-weighted SE sequences are the most accurate at MR imaging.

There were 11 men and one woman, 25&ndash;82 years of age (mean age 48 years). Four patients did not have a documented history of gout at the time of the MR examination. The diagnosis of intra-articular tophi was provided by arthroscopy and histological examination (5 patients), by microscopic study of joint fluid (5 patients), or by characteristic clinical, laboratory and imaging findings (2 patients). <I>Results.</I> In 15 MR examinations the tophi were located purely intra-articularly in 10 knees. In the remaining five MR studies, periarticular soft tissues or bone, or both, were involved. All the intra-articular tophi manifested low to intermediate signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. All five Gd-enhanced MR examinations demonstrated a heterogeneous peripheral enhancement. All 10 CT scans showed varying degrees of stippled calcifications within the tophi. The nature of the calcifications was confirmed on histological examination in three patients. <I>Conclusion.</I> Presenting clinical manifestations of gout may relate to intra-articular tophaceous deposits. Such deposits present as masses on MR images with low to intermediate signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images and a characteristic enhancement pattern following intravenous Gd administration. These features relate primarily to internal calcifications, which are most evident on CT images.

Imaging modalities used to date for its evaluation have limitations in their ability to fully characterize intra-articular crystal deposition. Since Computed Tomography (CT) imaging provides excellent visualization of bones and calcified tissue, in this pilot project we evaluated the utility of CT scan in describing intra-articular calcium crystal deposition in the knees. Method: We included 12 subjects with and four subjects without radiographic chondrocalcinosis in the most recent visit from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) study, which is a longitudinal cohort of community-dwelling older adults with or at risk for knee OA. All subjects underwent CT scans of bilateral knees. Each knee was divided into 25 subregions and each subregion was read for presence of calcium crystals by a musculoskeletal radiologist. To assess reliability, readings were repeated 4 weeks later. Results: CT images permitted visualization of 25 subregions with calcification within and around the tibio-femoral and patello-femoral joints in all 24 knees with radiographic chondrocalcinosis. Intra-articular calcification was seen universally including meniscal cartilage (most common site involved in 2&frac12;4 knees), hyaline cartilage, cruciate ligaments, medial collateral ligament and joint capsule. Readings showed good agreement for specific tissues involved with calcium deposition (kappa: 0.70, 95% CI 0.62-0.80). Conclusion: We found CT scan to be a useful and reliable tool for describing calcium crystal deposition in the knee and therefore potentially for studying role of calcium crystals in OA. We also confirmed that ''chondrocalcinosis'' is a misnomer because calcification is present ubiquitously.","Misra, D.;Guermazi, A.;Sieren, J.P.;Lynch, J.;Torner, J.;Neogi, T.;Felson, D.T.;",2,1,pp.244-248,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.joca.2014.10.009,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART71284153,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART71284153&type=mobile,CT imaging .

We compared radiography, CT, and MR imaging for assessing the extent and severity of osteoarthritis of the knee in 20 patients. Radiography included posteroanterior weight-bearing, true lateral, and sunrise patellar projections. Axial CT scans were reformatted in sagittal and coronal planes. MR imaging consisted of spin-echo (600-800/20; 2000/60, 120 [TR/TE]), and gradient-echo (600/30, theta = 30 degrees) sequences. The severity of osteoarthritic changes was graded from 0 to 3. MR frequently showed tricompartmental cartilage loss when radiography and CT showed only bicompartmental involvement in the medial and patellofemoral compartments. In the lateral compartment, MR showed a higher prevalence of cartilage loss (60%) than radiography (35%) and CT (25%) did. In the medial compartment, CT and MR showed osteophytes in 100% of the knees, whereas radiography showed osteophytes in only 60%. Notably, radiography often failed to show osteophytes in the posterior medial femoral condyle. On MR images, meniscal degeneration or tears were found in all 20 knees studied. Partial and complete tears of the anterior cruciate ligament were found in three and seven patients, respectively. MR is more sensitive than radiography and CT for assessing the extent and severity of osteoarthritic changes and frequently shows tricompartmental disease in patients in whom radiography and CT show only bicompartmental involvement.

A study from our department has however proven otherwise. We therefore found it interesting to investigate this further by looking at the level of agreement between different imaging modalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the level of agreement between the three radiological modalities, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and digital radiography (DR), in assessing the ossification of the epiphyses of the knee. A total of 34 deceased individuals of 10&#x2013;25 years of age, brought in for a medicolegal autopsy at our department, were scanned by CT, MRI, and DR. The ossification stages of the three bones of the right knee, distal femoral, proximal tibial, and proximal fibular epiphysis were assessed using the established combined staging method by Schmeling et al. and Kellinghaus et al. Analysis of the results by Cohen&rsquo;s weighted kappa showed a good agreement between CT and DR (<I>K</I> = 0.61&#x2013;0.70), and MRI and DR (<I>K</I> = 0.68&#x2013;0.79) but only moderate agreement between CT and MRI (<I>K</I> = 0.55&#x2013;0.57). This leads us to conclude that different radiological images cannot be used interchangeably for age estimation purposes, so reference material needs to be imaging-modality specific.

Therefore, the micro-structure of the knee joint was studied by synchrotron radiation phasecontrast CT imaging (SRPCI-CT). The contrast and the sharpness of the reconstructed slice were calculated and analysed. From these results, the layer structure of the joint tissue can be seen. The cartilage layer (including the meniscus) is about 1.44 mm, and the epiphyseal layer is about 2.25 mm, which conforms to the actual situation of rat knees. From the 3D images, the structure of the meniscus and the epiphyseal bone can be observed. The epiphyseal bone line is also particularly obvious. Simultaneously, the epiphyseal bone also has a mesh structure, which has the characteristics of both cartilage and tibia. Further research on the tibia can determine that the trabecular bone line is about 130 microns. Finally, the bone volume fraction (BVF) of the joint, the data also reflect the existence of a layer structure, and its scale distribution is consistent with the results of sharpness and contrast analysis.

Despite its importance, this process currently lacks automation. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to automate implant size prediction.Methods A total of 13,281 (2938 anteroposterior, 10,343 lateral) knee radiographs obtained from the authors’ institute were utilized for model training, with 2302 (1034 anteroposterior, 1268 lateral) images set apart for validation and testing.The templating AI model integrates a pipeline composed of multiple steps for automated implant size estimation.To predict implant size, anterioposterior (AP) and lateral radiograph predictions were merged, selecting the smaller of the predicted sizes to prevent implant overhang. The model’s size predictions were validated with 81 real TKA data set apart from the training data, and its accuracy was compared to that of manual templating by an orthopedic specialist. Predictions matching the actual implanted sizes were labeled “exact” and those within one size, “accurate.” The influence of patient characteristics on the model’s prediction accuracy was also analyzed. The measurement time elapsed for implant sizing was recorded for both the AI model and the orthopedic specialist. Implant position predicted by the model was validated by comparing insert locations with postoperative images.Results Compared with data from 81 actual TKA procedures, the model provided exact predictions for 39.5% of femoral and 43.2% of tibial components. Allowing a one-size margin of error, 88.9% of predictions were deemed “accurate” for both components. Interobserver reliability (Cohen’s kappa) were 0.60 and 0.70 for femoral and tibial implants, respectively, both classified as “substantial.” The orthopedic specialist produced results accurate within one-size margin of error in 95.1% and 100% of cases for femoral and tibial components, respectively. Interobserver reliability between the orthopedic specialist and ground truth was 0.76 and 0.8 for femoral and tibial components, respectively.The measurement time per case was 48.7 s for the AI model, compared with 97.5 s for the orthopedic specialist. Compared with postoperative radiographs, predicted implant position had an error of less than 4 mm on average.Conclusions An AI-based templating tool for TKA was successfully developed, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. Its application could significantly reduce the clinical workload in TKA preparation.","Jaeseok Park;Sung Eun Kim;Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Seoul National University Hospital);Back Kim;Sanggyu Lee;Jae-Jun Lee;Du Hyun Ro;",0,0,pp.38-38,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s43019-024-00240-7,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003211058,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003211058,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003211058&type=mobile,,,knee arthroplasty model

Despite the good to excellent long-term results, some patients remain dissatisfied. Our study aimed at establishing a predictive model to aid patient selection and decision-making in TKA. Methods: Using data from our prospective arthroplasty outcome database, 113 patients were included. Preoperatively and postoperatively, the patients completed 107 questions in 5 questionnaires: Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Oxford Knee Score, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Euroqol questionnaire, and Knee Scoring System. First, outcome parameters were compared between the satisfied and dissatisfied group. Second, we developed a new prediction tool using regression analysis. Each outcome score was analyzed with simple regression. Subsequently, the predictive weight of individual questions was evaluated applying multiple linear regression. Finally, 10 questions were retained to construct a new prediction tool. Results: Overall satisfaction rate in this study was found to be 88%. We identified a significant difference between the satisfied and dissatisfied group when looking at the preoperative questionnaires. Dissatisfied patients had more preoperative symptoms (such as stiffness), less pain, and a lower quality of life. They were more likely to ruminate and had a lower preoperative Knee Scoring System satisfaction score. The developed prediction tool consists of 10 simple but robust questions. Sensitivity was 97% with a positive-predictive value of 93%. Conclusions: Based upon preoperative parameters, we were able to partially predict satisfaction and dissatisfaction after TKA. After further validation, this new prediction tool for patient satisfaction following TKA may allow surgeons and patients to evaluate the risks and benefits of surgery on an individual basis and help in patient selection.","Van Onsem, S.;Van Der Straeten, C.;Arnout, N.;Deprez, P.;Van Damme, G.;Victor, J.;",2,1,pp.2660-2667.e1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2016.06.004,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76820859,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76820859&type=mobile,total knee arthroplasty . patient satisfaction . patient-reported outcome measures . prediction of satisfaction . indication for TKA,,knee arthroplasty model

Conversely, UKA is also associated with a higher revision risk than TKA. In order to further clarify the key differences between these separate procedures, the current study assessing the cost-effectiveness of UKA versus TKA was undertaken. Methods: A state-transition Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of UKA versus TKA for unicondylar osteoarthritis using a Belgian payer's perspective. The model was designed to include the possibility of two revision procedures. Model estimates were obtained through literature review and revision rates were based on registry data. Threshold analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess the model's robustness. Results: UKA was associated with a cost reduction of @?2,807 and a utility gain of 0.04 quality-adjusted life years in comparison with TKA. Analysis determined that the model is sensitive to clinical effectiveness, and that a marginal reduction in the clinical performance of UKA would lead to TKA being the more cost-effective solution. Conclusion: UKA yields clear advantages in terms of costs and marginal advantages in terms of health effects, in comparison with TKA.","Peersman, G.;Jak, W.;Vandenlangenbergh, T.;Jans, C.;Cartier, P.;Fennema, P.;",2,1,pp.S37-S42,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0968-0160(14)50008-7,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70443285,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70443285&type=mobile,Knee .

Our purpose was to test the external validity of a recently developed prognostic instrument designed to estimate the probability of nonresponse following KA. Methods: We used data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), a 9-year multisite National Institutes of Health study designed to examine the natural history of knee osteoarthritis in 4796 subjects. A total of 427 subjects underwent KA over the study period. Dowsey et al examined the prognostic role of obesity, general mental health, pain and function, and Kellgren and Lawrence knee osteoarthritis grades. Calibration of the prognostic model was determined using a calibration curve. The c-statistic was used to indicate discrimination of the model. Results: In the primary analysis, 63 (19.3%) of 326 subjects in OAI were classified as nonresponders. The calibration curve generated from OAI data indicated poor calibration relative to the recently developed instrument. Discrimination as measured by the c-statistic was 0.76. Conclusion: The external validity of the prognostic instrument was partially supported. While discrimination of the model was very similar to the recently developed instrument, calibration was poor indicating poor agreement between actual vs predicted probabilities of nonresponse. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and Kellgren and Lawrence grades show strong potential for use in future prognostic model development. Measurements of general mental health and obesity were not prognostic for nonresponse.","Riddle, D.L.;Golladay, G.J.;Jiranek, W.A.;Perera, R.A.;",2,1,pp.1153-1158.e1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2016.11.007,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART77562573,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART77562573&type=mobile,knee . arthroplasty . nomogram . prognosis . pain . function,,knee arthroplasty model

An advanced knee simulator (AKS) model based on computed tomography (CT) scans was developed in the setting of these challenges with cadavers and previous models. In this study, we compared the ligament balancing between AKS and human cadaveric knees to assess the validity of using the AKS for ligament balancing training during TKA. A CT scan of a TKA patient with varus deformity was used to design the AKS model with modular components, using three-dimensional printing. Three fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeons used technology-assisted TKA procedure to plan and balance three cadaver knees and the AKS model. Medial and lateral laxity data were captured using manual varus and valgus stress assessments for cadavers and the model in an extension pose (10 degrees of flexion from terminal extension) and between 90 and 95 degrees for flexion. After preresection assessments, surgeons planned a balanced cruciate-retaining TKA. Following bony cuts and trialing, extension and flexion ligament laxity values were recorded in a similar manner. Descriptive statistics and Student's t-tests were performed to compare the cadavers and model with a p-value set at 0.05. Preresection medial/lateral laxity data for both extension and flexion were plotted and showed that the highest standard deviation (SD) for the cadavers was 0.67 mm, whereas the highest SD for the AKS was 1.25 mm. A similar plot for trialing demonstrated that the highest SD for the cadavers was 0.6 mm, whereas the highest SD for the AKS was 0.61 mm. The AKS trialing data were highly reproducible when compared with cadaveric data, demonstrating the value of the AKS model as a tool to teach ligament balancing for TKA and for future research endeavors.</P></P>","Logan, Scott;Sequeira, Sean B.;Jerabek, Seth A.;Malkani, Arthur L.;Mahoney, Ormond M.;Crutcher, James P.;Mont, Michael A.;Faizan, Ahmad;",2,1,pp.873-878,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-2343-2346,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132126589,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132126589&type=mobile,,,knee arthroplasty model

Currently, the effectiveness of the Stepped Care Model in postoperative rehabilitation for TKA (Total Knee Arthroplasty) patients has not been reported. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate whether the stepped care model could improve early-stage self-report quality of life and knee function after total knee arthroplasty via a prospective randomized controlled design. METHODS: It was a mono-center, parallel-group, open-label, prospective randomized controlled study. Patients who aging from 60-75 years old as well as underwent unilateral primary total knee arthroplasty due to end-stage knee osteoarthritis between 2020.06 to 2022.02 were enrolled. Participants were randomized and arranged into two groups in a 1:1 allocation. The control group was given traditional rehabilitation guidance, while the stepped care model group was given continued stepped care. Hospital for special surgery knee score, daily living ability (ADL), knee flexion range, and adverse events at 1, 3, and 6 months after total knee arthroplasty were recorded. RESULTS: 88 patients proceeded to the final analysis. There was no significant difference of age, gender, length of stay, BMI, and educational level between the two groups at the baseline. After specific stepped care model interventions, patients showed significant improvements in HHS in 1 month (85.00 (82.25, 86.00) vs. 80.00 (75.00, 83.00), p< 0.001), 3 months (88.00 (86.00, 92.00) vs. 83.00 (76.75, 85.00), p< 0.001), and 6 months (93.00 (90.25, 98.00) vs. 88.00 (84.25, 91.75), p< 0.001) when compared with the control group. Similar results were also found in both daily living ability and knee flexion angle measurements. No adverse event was observed during the follow-up. CONCLUSION: The present study found that the stepped care model intervention significantly improved early-stage knee function and self-reported life quality after total knee arthroplasty due to knee osteoarthritis. Female patients and those less than 70 years old benefit more from the stepped care model intervention after total knee arthroplasty.</P>","Hu, Xia;Jiang, Huiqing;Liu, Peizhen;Li, Zhiquan;Zhang, Ruiying;",2,1,pp.4593-4601,https://doi.org/10.3233/thc-240780,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132609671,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132609671&type=mobile,,,knee arthroplasty model
