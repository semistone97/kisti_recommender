To extract crustal magnetic anomalies from the measurements of NASA's Magsat mission, we separate crustal signals from both core and external field effects. In particular, we define Magsat anomalies relative to the degree 11 field and use spectral correlation theory to reduce them for external field effects. We obtain a model of Antarctic crustal thickness by comparing the region's terrain gravity effects to free-air gravity anomalies derived from the Earth Gravity Model 1996 (EGM96). To separate core and crustal magnetic effects, we obtain the pseudo-magnetic effect of the crustal thickness variations from their gravity effect via Poisson's theorem for correlative potentials. We compare the pseudo-magnetic effect of the crustal thickness variations to field differences between degrees 11 and 13 by spectral correlation analysis. We thus identify and remove possible residual core field effects in the Magsat anomalies relative to the degree 11 core field. The resultant anomalies reflect possible Antarctic contrasts due both to crustal thickness and intracrustal variations of magnetization. In addition, they provide important constraints on the geologic interpretation of aeromagnetic survey data, such as are available for the Weddell Province. These crustal anomalies also may be used to correct for long wavelength errors in regional compilations of near-surface magnetic survey data. However, the validity of these applications is limited by the poor quality of the Antarctic Magsat data that were obtained during austral Summer and Fall when south polar external field activity was maximum. Hence an important test and supplement for the Antarctic crustal Magsat anomaly map will be provided by the data from the recently launched Ørsted mission, which will yield coverage over austral Winter and Spring periods when external field activity is minimal.</P>","R.

Twelve species of Antarctic diatoms were counted, and three of these (Nitzschia kerguelensis, Eucampia antarctica and Coscinodiscus lentiginosus) occur in sufficient quantity for statistically meaningful interpretations. The number of diatom specimens per gram of carbonate-free sediment was determined for core top, last glacial maximum, last interglacial, and penultimate glacial maximum intervals. Antarctic diatoms are abundant in cores from depths in excess of 4100 m and disappear abruptly in core tops between approximately 4125 and 3975 m water depth. No specimens of Antarctic diatoms are present in cores shallower than 3744 m. The top of this transition zone corresponds with the isotherms @? = 1.9<SUP>o</SUP>C and the isopycnal &sigma;<SUB>4</SUB> = 45.93 that Hogg et al. (1982) selected as a suitable reference level between northward and southward flow in the Vema Channel axis. The sediments from the Vema Channel indicate no significant shallowing or deepening of this level during the glacial or interglacial intervals examined. Displaced Antarctic diatoms are generally less abundant during glacial maxima than during interglacials. Downcore counts of displaced Antarctic diatoms reveal two peaks of dramatically increased abundances at the isotopic stage 67 and 32 boundaries.

The study is principally concerned with species diversity, originations and extinctions, inter-relationships between species and the relationship of the fauna to different water masses. With respect to species diversity and origination/extinction patterns, two distinct phases are apparent: an initial diversification (originations only), followed by a phase of overall stable diversity (originations approximately matched by extinctions). The ostracod fauna is closely comparable to that described by authors as typical of North Atlantic Deep Water but is actually from the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW).

These facies represent the passage of distinct depositional regimes across the core sites, including sub-ice shelf beneath a basal debris zone; sub-ice shell distal to a debris zone; calving-line transition; and open marine.

The Vorcore campaign (September 2005 to February 2006) consisted in the flight of 27 superpressure balloons in the core of the Southern Hemisphere stratospheric polar vortex at altitudes of 16-19 km, from September 2005 to February 2006. On 7 October 2005, one of the balloons exploded as it was flying above the Antarctic Peninsula. The observations collected by another balloon that was flying during the same time period above the peninsula suggest the presence of a very intense gravity wave (peak&#x2010;to&#x2010;peak amplitude of the order of 25-30 m s<SUP>&#x2212;1</SUP> in zonal and meridional velocity disturbances). The wave packet is likely undersampled in the balloon observations because of its high intrinsic frequency, but the balloon data set is complemented with high&#x2010;resolution numerical simulations carried out with the Weather Research and Forecast Model. The simulations are validated by comparison with the balloon measurements and show that the wave was breaking in the lower stratosphere at the time and height where the balloon exploded. The simulations highlight several consequences of the mountain wave on the stratosphere: forcing of the mean flow, generation of secondary inertia&#x2010;gravity waves, and turbulence and mixing. In particular, the momentum fluxes are calculated and are found to compare well with the estimates from balloon measurements. The large values found are likely extreme values, which raises the issue of their representativity.

Regional gaps in the near-surface surveys were then filled with predictions from crustal magnetization models that jointly satisfied the near-surface and satellite crustal anomalies. Comparisons in some of the regional gaps that also considered newly acquired aeromagnetic data demonstrated the enhanced anomaly estimation capabilities of the predictions over those from conventional minimum curvature and spherical harmonic geomagnetic field models.

Robertson shelf, East Antarctica: initial results and palaeoenvironmental implications","<jats:p>Sediments from the Antarctic continental margin may provide detailed
                  palaeoenvironmental records for Antarctic shelf waters during the late Quaternary.
                  Here we present results from a palaeoenvironmental study of two sediment cores
                  recovered from the continental shelf off Mac. Robertson Land, East Antarctica.
                  These gravity cores were collected approximately 90 km apart from locations on the
                  inner and outer shelf. Both cores are apparently undisturbed sequences of diatom
                  ooze mixed with fine, quartz-rich sand. Core stratigraphies have been established
                  from radiocarbon analyses of bulk organic carbon. Down-core geochemical
                  determinations include the lithogenic components AÍ and Fe, biogenic components
                  opal and organic carbon, and palaco-redox proxies Mn, Mo and U. We use the
                  geochemical data to infer past variations in the deposition of biogenic and
                  lithogenic materials, and the radiocarbon dates to estimate average sediment
                  accumulation rates. The Holocene record of the outer-shelf core suggests three
                  episodes of enhanced diatom export production at about 1.8, 3.8 and 5.5 ka BP, as
                  well as less pronounced bloom episodes which occurred over a shorter period.
                  Average sediment accumulation rates at this location range from 13.7 cm
                     ka<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the late Pleistocene early Holocene to 82 cm
                     ka<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the late Holocene, and suggest that the inferred
                  episodes of enhanced biogenic production lasted 100-1000 years. in contrast, data
                  for the inner-shelf core suggest that there has been a roughly constant proportion
                  of biogenic and lithogenic material accumulating during the middle to late
                  Holocene, with a greater proportion of biogenic material relative to the outer
                  shelf. Notably, there is an approximately 7-fold increase in average sediment
                  accumulation rate (from 24.5 to 179 cm ka<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) at this
                  inner-shelf location between the middle and late Holocene, with roughly comparable
                  increases in the mass accumulation rates of both biogenic and lithogenic material.
                  This may represent changes in sediment transport processes, or reflect real
                  increases in pelagic sedimentation in this region during the Holocene. Our results
                  suggest quite different sedimentation regimes in these two shelf locations during
                  the middle to late Holocene.</jats:p>",Sedwick P. N.;Harris P.T.;Robertson L. G.;Mcmurtry G. M.;Cremer M.

The studied cores, each about 6.5？m-long, were collected at a depth of 3700&ndash;4100？m below the sea level, on the distal gentle side of sediment Drift 7, and consist of very fine-grained sediments spanning through various glacial&ndash;interglacial cycles. Detailed analysis of the paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data allowed to reconstruct relative paleointensity (RPI) records (NRM<SUB>20？mT</SUB>/ARM<SUB>20？mT</SUB>) for each core. We established a refined age model for the studied sequences by correlating individual SEDANO RPI curves to the global RPI stack SINT-800 [Y. Guyodo, J.-P. Valet, Global changes in intensity of the Earth's magnetic field during the past 800？kyr, Nature 399 (1999) 249&ndash;252]. The individual normalized SEDANO RPI records are in mutual close agreement; they were thus merged in a RPI stacking curve spanning the last 270？kyr and showing a low standard deviation. This study also points out that RPI records may provide a viable tool to date otherwise difficult-to-date sedimentary sequences, such as those deposited along peri-Antarctic margins. The new RPI chronology indicates that the sampled sedimentary sequence is younger than previously thought and allows a new high-resolution correlation to oxygen isotope stages. Furthermore, we recognized variations in the rock magnetic parameters that appear to be climatically-driven, with changes in the relative proportion of two magnetic mineral populations with distinct coercivities. Rock magnetic and lithological trends observed in the SEDANO cores indicate that during the climatic cycles of the Late Pleistocene this sector of the peri-Antarctic margin was subjected to subtle, yet identifiable, environmental changes, confirming a relatively higher instability of the West Antarctic ice sheet with respect to the East Antarctic counterpart.</P>","Macr&igrave;, Patrizia;Sagnotti, Leonardo;Lucchi, Renata Giulia;Rebesco, Michele;",2,1,pp.162-179,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2006.09.037,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART30280697,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART30280697&type=mobile,Paleomagnetism .

Gravity anomalies can be mapped across the oceans through satellite altimetry, and these data hold valuable information about the nature and spatial variation of oceanic crust. Residual mantle Bouguer anomaly (RMBA) reflects variations in crustal thickness and crustal and mantle densities. It was simply treated as an upper mantle gravity component and a crustal gravity component in our model of a lithospheric depth. The upper mantle gravity component results from variations in mantle temperature, mantle porosity and mantle depletion due to partial melting initiating at depths of 80&ndash;100 km. The crustal gravity component results from variations in crustal thickness. RMBA contributed by mantle temperature variation of 200 K, mantle depletion of 5% and mantle porosity of 5% are 46, 16 and 21 mGal, respectively. Upper mantle gravity variations do not exceed 46 mGal, and variations in oceanic crustal thickness or deeper mantle effects have to be considered for areas with RMBA variations greater than 46 mGal. Assuming a standard RMBA of a reference crust is 0 mGal, we partitioned the RMBA in the Indian Ocean into three categories: &lsquo;negative&rsquo; (less than &minus;46 mGal), &lsquo;normal&rsquo; (between &minus;46 and 46 mGal) and &lsquo;positive&rsquo; (>46 mGal), corresponding to thick, normal and thin oceanic crust, respectively. Thick oceanic crustal anomalies are associated with hotspots or plumes and are distributed along hotspot tracks. Prominent thin oceanic crustal anomalies are observed along fracture zones, around Rodriguez Triple Junction (RTJ) and Australian&#8208;Antarctic Discordance (AAD). Besides the possible effects of fracture zones, oceanic core complex or some other enigmatic deep mantle factors must be responsible for the positive gravity anomalies and crustal thinning.

We compare results from three different ice sheet models and three    different Earth viscosity models at a 10 ice core sites. As expected, the    ice-thinning signal at West Antarctic sites is the largest contributor to    elevation-induced temperature changes. The signal predicted by the ice    models considered produced 100-200% of the total glacial to interglacial    signal in &delta;D, indicating that the deglacial ice thinning is overestimated    by an amount approaching an order of magnitude at some locations. This    indicates that the total volume loss in these models is considerably    overestimated. Furthermore, the predicted rate of this change is not    supported by the isotope data and so, again, most likely reflects    inaccuracies in the adopted ice models. Estimates of contemporary ice mass    changes inferred from satellite gravity data corrected using any of these    models with therefore be biased as a result. The isostatic signal acts to    reduce the total elevation change at most sites and has a relatively small    magnitude (a few% to &sim;20% of that due to the ice thickness change) so is    secondary at most sites and for most of the time. However, our results    indicate that it could be the dominant control on elevation at some West    Antarctic sites during the Holocene, resulting in a secular cooling signal    of &sim;10-20%% in &delta;D.

The 5.95m gravity core used in    this study records paleoenvironmental changes during the last approximately    600ka. Down-core variations in trace element, rare earth element, and Nd    and Sr isotopic compositions reveal that sediment provenance varied    according to glacial cycles. During glacial periods, detrital sediments in    the southern Drake Passage were mostly derived from the nearby South    Shetland Islands and shelf sediments. In contrast, interglacial sediments    are composed of mixed sediments, derived from both West Antarctica and East    Antarctica. The East Antarctic provenance of the interglacial sediments was    inferred to be the Weddell Sea region. Sediment input from the Weddell Sea    was reduced during glacial periods by extensive ice sheets and weakened    current from the Weddell Sea. Sediment supply from the Weddell Sea    increased during interglacial periods, especially those with higher warmth    such as MIS 5, 9, and 11. This suggests that the influence of deep water    from the Weddell Sea increases during interglacial periods and decreases    during glacial periods, with the degree of influence increasing as    interglacial intensity increases.","Lee, J.I.;Yoon, H.I.;Yoo, K.C.;Lim, H.S.;Lee, Y.I.;Kim, D.;Bak, Y.S.;Itaki, T.;",2,1,pp.119-129,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2012.03.010,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART63308981,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART63308981&type=mobile,Geochemistry .

The clay mineral chlorite can be used to identify southern-source waters (AABW) in the Vema Channel. The mineralogical identification of the upper limit of AABW occurs at approximately 4000-4100 m, in agreement with estimates based upon displaced Antarctic diatoms and modern oceanographic data. Time-slice reconstructions of chlorite abundance suggest AABW flow intensity was slightly reduced during glacial relative to interglacial intervals. The clay mineral kaolinite reaches maximum concentration at mid depth (approximately 3500 m) on the Rio Grande Rise but does not appear to be advectively transported to the Rise by southward-flowing NADW, rather kaolinite-rich sediments appear to be transported eastward from the Sao Paulo Plateau to the Rio Grande Rise along isopycnals.

Downcore remanent magnetic (RM) and magnetic fabric measurements have been performed on these samples to examine the effects of depositional mechanisms on the magnetization of sediment at both sites. Vector diagrams after stepwise a.f. demagnetization to 50 mT for both suites of samples indicate variable RM stability above 8-10 cm depth. Below this depth, samples exhibit a stable, apparently primary RM after demagnetization to fields of 10 mT. These results indicate that if the RM is to be used to orient these deep-sea cores, samples should be chosen from greater than 10 cm depth in core and demagnetized to at least 10 mT. Fabric analyses, based on anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) measurements, reveal primary sedimentary fabric in most cores from the U.S. continental margin, but anomalous fabric below 40-80 cm depth in some Vema Channel cores. This anomalous fabric is believed to be the result of soft-sediment deformation at the site. AMS long-axis alignments are essentially random for these Vema Channel cores.

Nine sediment samples, ranging in depth from 3 to 7.5 m, were isolated from two gravity cores taken proximal to a volcanic plug in Bransfield Strait. The samples were analyzed for elemental abundances (C, N), stable isotope compositions (&delta;<SUP>13</SUP>C, &delta;<SUP>15</SUP>N), and amino acid distributions and stereochemistry in order to assess the effects of hydrothermal stress on organic matter associated with these sediments. In general, %TOC and %N decrease slightly with increasing depth in each core, whereas C/N, % carbonate C and &delta;<SUP>13</SUP>C and &delta;<SUP>15</SUP>N remain essentially constant. Total amino acid abundances decrease significantly down core, particularly in the lowermost samples which may have come in direct contact with hydrothermal fluids. Also, with increasing depth, the water extractable ''free'' amino acids comprise a slightly larger percentage of the total amino acid fraction. Qualitatively, the amino acid distributions reflect the predominance of a diatom input to the sedimentary record. This biogenic signature remains evident despite diagenetic effects that become more pronounced with depth. Individual amino acid D/L values for the total sediment acid hydrolyzates of upper samples in each core remain relatively constant and are consistent with their age. Amino acid D/L values for the lower samples of each core, however, increase dramatically and suggest the occurrence of hydrothermal activity. Inherent complexities of this dynamic system severely limit the possibility of using amino acid racemization data to place constraints on the magnitude and duration of this postulated hydrothermal episode.","Silfer, J.A.;Engel, M.H.;Macko, S.A.;",2,1,pp.159-167,https://doi.org/10.1016/0883-2927(90)90046-8,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17443713,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17443713&type=mobile,,,Antarctic gravity core

The past variations of ice sheet provide clues for predicting future changes of global environment and its impacts to the global climate change. The glaciomarine sedimentation on the Antarctic continental shelf is greatly influenced by the changes of ice sheets. Therefore, the research on the glaciomarine sedimentation changes on the Antarctic continental shelf provide a crucial key for inferring the development of ice sheet activity in response to the paleoenvironmental changes. Although the numerous studies of paleoenvironmental changes have been conducted in the Ross Sea continental shelf including Drygalski Basin, most studies have focused on the retreat of ice sheets and ice shelves, with limited researches related to the Holocene climate changes being either temporal duration or spatial areas, since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). In this dissertation, core sediments obtained from the northern Drygalski Basin were used to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental changes since the LGM and to reveal the variations in glaciomarine sedimentation related to the Holocene climate changes. &amp;#xD; In the northern Drygalski Basin, three gravity cores (DG12-GC01, DG12-GC02, and DG12-GC04) were obtained along the central part of basin, and one gravity core (DG12-GC005) was obtained from the southeastern flank. Multi-proxies including sediment properties, geochemical proxies, carbon isotopic values of sediment organic matter, clay mineral compositions of fine-grained sediments, and diatom assemblage were analyzed with Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) 14C age dating of acid insoluble organic matter (AIOM) for the evolution of glaciomarine sediment depositional environment since the LGM. Based on the sediment properties, the core sediments were classified into the seven sediment facies (clast-rich muddy diamicton, clast-rich sandy diamicton, massive mud, laminated mud, bioturbated mud, massive sandy mud, and bioturbated sandy mud). The association of these sediment facies defines the four lithologic units in terms of the depositional evolution. Lithologic unit 1 represents diamicton deposited proximal to the grounding line. When the ice sheet and ice shelf retreated since the LGM, the unsorted sediment mass was deposited proximal to the grounding line. Lithologic unit 2 consists of the massive mud deposited under the sub-ice shelf condition. During the ice sheet retreat, the fine-grained particles were transported by the meltwater plume to the sub-ice shelf floor. The biogenic materials were also transported from the seasonal open marine area to the sub-ice shelf by the currents. Lithologic unit 3 was composed of sandy mud and mud with abundant dropstones that might have been deposited at the calving line. As the calving line passed the Drygalski Basin, a large amount of the coarse fractions was deposited due to ice shelf breakup. The terrestrial sediments from the Victoria Land coast were transported from the grounding line of the remained local ice sheet, when the calving line passed the north side of Drygalski Ice Tongue. Lithologic unit 4 comprises the bioturbated mud and sandy mud that were deposited under the seasonally open marine environment. The biological productivity increased significantly during the late Holocene, while the terrestrial sedimentation decreased under seasonal open marine conditions. The diatom assemblage and δ13C values of sediment organic matter indicate the mid-Holocene warm climate with more sea ice melting. Since the LGM, the paleoenvironmental change and glaciomarine depositional evolution on the northern Drygalski Basin were closely linked with the ice sheet dynamics and ice shelf activity, in addition to the climate change during the Holocene. &amp;#xD; Two gravity cores (DG12-GC03 and RS19-GC02) and one jumbo piston core (RS15-LC100) were obtained from the north of Drygalski Ice Tongue, to reveal the ice activity related to the climate changes during the Holocene. Same multi-proxies of the previous study were conducted with AMS 14C age dating of AIOM. The sediments were classified into six sediment facie: (clast-rich muddy diamicton, laminated mud and sandy mud, sandy mud with dropstones, upward fining muddy sand with mud lumps, massive mud, and bioturbated mud and sandy mud) that comprise four lithological units in terms of the depositional successions. Lithological unit I represents diamicton deposited proximal to the grounding line of the retreating ice sheet at ~8.1 ka. Lithologic unit II was deposited by the meltwater plume under sub-ice shelf condition, characterized by seasonally open marine sediments after the retreat of the ice shelf at ~4.5 ka. Lithological unit IV consists of bioturbated mud and sandy mud with Ice-rafted debris (IRD), similar to the present-day seasonally open marine environment. However, lithological unit III has not been reported in the Dryglaski Basin. Multi-proxies of unit III characterize the debris flow deposit (i.e. debrite) triggered by the readvanced ice sheet during the late Holocene. Based on the paleoclimate proxies, the climatic cooling phase such as the Neoglaciation might have caused the readvance of ice sheet, which generated the debris flow to transport a large amount of eroded sediments to the Terra Nova Bay. The readvance of ice sheet might have occurred from the south of Terra Nova Bay.

A multivariate statistical analysis based on geochemical, granulometric and environmental parameters identifies five distinct sediment groups located in different areas of sedimentation and with peculiar geochemical characteristics.Group 1, on the external platform, which comprises very fine sediments, is characterised by the highest contents of Mg, LOI, Cr, Ni and V, and of Cu and Zn. Group 2, from the banks formed by pelitic sands, is distinguished on the basis of lower Cu and Zn and higher Cr and Si. Group 3, on the internal platform consisting of sandy sediments, comprises high values of Na, Al, Ca and Pb and low values of Zn and V. Group 4, in the coarse coastal sands, is enriched in Co and Ca, Na, K and Al. Group 5, formed by materials with different grain-size distribution located south of Coulman Island, is distinguished by a very high content of Zn, Fe, Ti and Na, with Cr, Co, Pb and Si being found at lower levels.The materials are glacial-detrital, are derived from the rocky hinterland formations, and are reworked by transport and deposition processes depending on the energy level of the marine sedimentary environments. Given the scarcity of comparison data from the hinterland rocks it is difficult to establish the parent rocks of these glaciomarine sediments on the basis of geochemical data alone. Only in the case of the sediments south of Coulman Island can one be certain of a contribution from the McMurdo volcanics. For the external platform sediments, the highest contents of Si and L.O.I. confirm the input of material from biogenic neoformation.","Merlin, O.H.;Salvador, G.L.;Vitturi, L.M.;Pistolato, M.;Rampazzo, G.;",2,1,pp.209-229,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0025-3227(91)90092-I,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17378790,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17378790&type=mobile,,,Ross Sea sediments

There, spores and pollen of Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary age predominate. Eocene dinoflagellates and rare Palaeozoic spores are also present. In the western half of the Ross Sea, densities of recycled palynomorphs are lower, but relative frequencies of Palaeozoic types are higher.On the continental shelf, the palynomorphs have been recovered, in equal abundance, from sediments identified as basal tills and compound glaci-marine sediments. Comparison of the observed patterns of distribution with patterns of ice flow in the Ross Ice Shelf shows a clear correlation between the high palynomorph densities in the southeastern Ross Sea and discharge from ice streams D and E. Geophysical information from aeromagnetic and radio-echo sounding surveys in the catchment areas of these ice streams suggests the most likely source for the recycled palynomorphs to be in a region of subdued topography inland of the present grounding line in the Marie Byrd Land sector of the Ross Ice Shelf, extending probably not further east than 130<SUP>o</SUP>W. This region probably represents a continuation of the easternmost Ross Sea Basin. The presence of marine Eocene sediments there, attested to by dinoflagellates in the recycled assemblages, accords with suggestions of a late Mesozoic-Cenozoic opening of the Ross Sea.The observed patterns of palynomorph distribution reflect input from ice drainage areas in both East and West Antarctica. The preservation of sediments of differing provenance in distinct areas on the sea floor probably indicates processes of meltout of debris near the grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf during past phases of expansion.

Further discussion on the slopes and Ce and Eu anomalies of chondrite-normalized REE patterns indicated that a mixing process of weathered bedrock, guano and algae was the main controlling factor for the fluctuations of REEs with depth in the sediments. An end-member equation was developed to calculate the proportion of REEs from the three constituents in the sediments. The calculation functioned well in estimating bedrock-derived REEs and the magnitude of ornithogenic influence in different profiles.

We believe this phenomenon may correspond to global warming of the last century, since warming-induced surface runoff would bring more inflow water and detritus to the coring sites, thus enhancing the difference among the profiles. To verify this hypothesis, the deposition rate against age of the sediments was calculated based on their determined chronology, which showed ascending trends in all four profiles.

Our data exhibit significant positive correlations between Hg concentration and total organic carbon (TOC) content in all profiles, suggesting the predominant role of organic matter (OM) as a Hg carrier. The OM in the sediments originates primarily from penguin guano and algae. High Hg content in guano and a positive correlation between Hg and a guano bio-element (phosphorus, P) in the ornithogenic sediment profiles (MB6, BI and CC) indicate that Hg was strongly influenced by guano input. The bottom sediments of MB6 with seal hairs contain relatively high Hg. This increase is attributed to the input of seal excrement, suggesting that sedimentary Hg may be an effective trophic-level indicator from seals to penguins.

Overall, the sedimentary record in the Ross Sea documents some key features of the paleoenvironmental processes in the Late Pleistocene, which could be correlated with large-scale changes in Antarctica and thus are worthy of further investigation in the future.</P>","Li, Guogang;Bu, Ruyuan;Yi, Liang;Hu, Bangqi;Li, Yunhai;Ji, Youjun;Li, Yixin;Wang, Liang;",2,1,pp.863336,https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.863336,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART119033859,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART119033859&type=mobile,,,Ross Sea sediments

The sites differed in trophic conditions related to organic matter (OM) composition and bacterial distribution. Carbohydrate concentrations at site B were about double those at site C, while protein and lipid levels were 10 times higher. Proteins were mainly found in a soluble fraction (&amp;gt;90%). Chloropigment content was generally low and phaeopigments were almost absent, indicating the presence of reduced inputs of primary organic matter. ATP concentrations (as a measure of the living microbial biomass) were significantly higher at site B. By contrast, benthic bacterial densities at site C were about double those at site B. Bacterial parameters do not appear to be &ldquo;bottom-up controlled&rdquo; by the amount of available food but rather &ldquo;top-down controlled&rdquo; by meiofauna predatory pressure, which was significantly higher at site B. Aminopeptidase and &beta;-glucosidase extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) in Antarctic sediments appear to be high and comparable to those reported for temperate or Arctic sediments and characterized by low aminopeptidase/&beta;-glucosidase ratios (about 10). Activity profiles showed decreasing patterns with increasing sediment depth, indicating vertical shifts in both availability and nutritional quality of degradable OM. Vertical profiles of aminopeptidase activity were related to a decrease in protein concentration and/or to an increase in the insoluble refractory proteinaceous fraction. The highest aminopeptidase activity rates were observed at site C, characterized by much lower protein concentrations. Differences in EEA between sites do not seem to be explained by differences in the in situ temperature (&#x2212;1.6 and &#x2212;0.8&deg;C at sites B and C, respectively). Aminopeptidase activity profiles are consistent with the bacterial biomass and frequency of dividing cells. Enzyme substrate affinity was generally dependent upon substrate concentrations. EEA, normalized to bacterial numbers, indicated specific activities comparable to those reported for equally deep sediments at temperate latitudes. Vertical patterns of specific enzymatic activity appeared to be controlled by chloroplastic pigment concentrations that accumulate in the deeper sediment layers. The overall conclusion from the analysis of EEA in Antarctic sediments is that enzyme-dependent transformations of OM proceed at rates similar to those measured in temperate environments. Protein carbon potentially liberated by aminopeptidase activities (12.597 to 26.190 mg of C m <SUP>&#x2212;2</SUP> day <SUP>&#x2212;1</SUP> ) indicates that the whole protein pool could be mobilized within 1.3 to 17 h. Carbohydrate carbon mobilization (773 to 2,552 mg of C m <SUP>&#x2212;2</SUP> day <SUP>&#x2212;1</SUP> ) is sufficient to turn over the carbohydrate pool within 16 to 20 h. Such rates are 6 to 45 times higher than fluxes of particulate organic proteins and carbohydrates, indicating an &ldquo;uncoupled hydrolysis&rdquo; by the Antarctic benthic assemblages, in which bacteria appear to be able to rapidly exploit episodic OM pulses. </P></P>","Fabiano, Mauro;Danovaro, Roberto;",2,1,pp.3838-3845,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.64.10.3838-3845.1998,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART07512004,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART07512004&type=mobile,,,Ross Sea sediments

Meanwhile, climate change in Antarctica has exhibited a zonally asymmetric pattern. However, few studies have linked the two. In this study, we conduct fully coupled model experiments and find that Antarctica responds more significantly to Asian AAs than to those from North America and Europe. Increased Asian AAs induce a tri&#x2010;polar anomaly pattern in Antarctica via a poleward propagating Rossby wave train. This pattern is characterized by warmer temperature and less sea ice in the Amundsen&#x2010;Bellingshausen Seas, and cooler temperature and more sea ice in regions on its both flanks.

Due to their short residence time in the atmosphere and high concentrations in the mid&#x2010;latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, the response of Antarctic climate to the zonal redistribution of AA emissions since the 1980s-characterized by a notable decline in North America and Europe, but a continuous increase in East and South Asia-has received little attention. Through idealized model simulations, we find that increased Asian AAs generate Rossby waves that propagate toward Antarctica in the upper troposphere. These waves modify atmospheric circulation in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, causing surface warming and sea ice loss in the Amundsen&#x2010;Bellingshausen Seas, and surface cooling and sea ice gain in the Weddell Sea and the region west of the Ross Sea. In contrast, reduced AAs in North America and Europe do not generate Rossby waves that reach Antarctica.

If the case, then according to Broecker (2000a, 2000b) Antarctica should have warmed during the LIA, when the Northern Hemisphere was cold.

Whilst we find there was large spatial and temporal variability, overall Antarctica was cooler and stormier during the LIA.

The absence of crabs and sharks, the limited diversity of teleosts and skates, the dominance of slow-moving invertebrates at higher trophic levels, and the occurrence of dense ophiuroid and crinoid populations indicate that skeleton-breaking predation is limited in Antarctica today, as it was worldwide during the Paleozoic and as it is in the deep sea today. The community structure of the antarctic benthos has its evolutionary roots in the Eocene. Data from fossil assemblages at Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula suggest that shallow-water communities were similar to communities at lower latitudes until they were affected by global cooling, which accelerated in the late Eocene to early Oligocene. That long-term cooling trend ultimately resulted in the polar climate and peculiar community structure found in Antarctica today. Declining temperatures beginning late in the Eocene are associated with the disappearance of crabs, sharks, and most teleosts. The sudden drop in predation pressure allowed dense ophiuroid and crinoid populations to appear and flourish. These late Eocene echinoderm populations exhibit low frequencies of sublethal damage (regenerating arms), demonstrating that there was little or no predation from skeleton-breaking fish and decapods. Current scenarios of global climate change include predictions of increased upwelling and consequent cooling in temperate and subtropical upwelling zones. Limited ecological evidence suggests that such cooling could disrupt trophic relationships and favor retrograde community structures in those local areas.","Aronson, RB;Blake, DB;",2,1,pp.27-39,https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/41.1.27,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART10738139,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART10738139&type=mobile,,,climate change Antarctica

In the second half of the twentieth century, the huge increase in energy and mineral consumption determined anthropogenic emissions of several metals exceeding those from natural sources, e.g., volcanoes and windborne soil particles. In the Northern Hemisphere, the biogeochemical cycles of Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, and other metals were significantly altered, even in Arctic regions. On the contrary, available data on trace metal concentrations in abiotic matrices from continental Antarctica, summarized in this review, suggest that the biogeochemical cycle of Pb is probably the only one that has been significantly altered by anthropogenic emissions in Antarctica and elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in the period 1950-1975. Environmental contamination by other metals from anthropogenic sources in Antarctica itself can generally only be detected in snow samples taken within a range of a few kilometers or several hundred meters from scientific stations. Local metal pollution from human activities in Antarctica may compromise studies aimed at assessing the biogeochemical cycle of trace elements and the effects of global climate change. Thus, this review focuses on concentrations of metals in atmospheric particulate, snow, surface soils, and freshwater from the Antarctic continent and surface sediments and seawater from the Southern Ocean, which can plausibly be regarded as global background values of trace elements. These baselines are also necessary in view of the construction of new stations, the expansion of existing facilities to support research, and the growth of tourism and fisheries. Despite difficulties in making comparisons with data from other remote areas of the world, concentrations of trace metals in most samples of atmospheric particulates, snow, ice, soils, and marine sediments from Antarctica can be taken as global background levels. Comparison between the results of trace element surveys in marine waters of the Southern Ocean and in other seas is practically impossible. The upwelling or subduction of water masses, the seasonality in ice cover and in phytoplankton biomass, the low fallout of atmospheric dust, and many other peculiar characteristics of the Southern Ocean make concentrations of trace metals in surface waters quite variable in space and time. The depletion of nutrients in surface waters, which is a regular feature of many marine environments, rarely occurs in the Southern Ocean. Waters in some regions are characterized by very low concentrations of Fe and Mn, whereas in others the content of Cd is relatively high at the beginning of summer and may decrease about one order of magnitude during the phytoplankton bloom. Although in most Antarctic coastal ecosystems the input of metals from geochemical and anthropogenic sources and from long-range transport is negligible, concentrations of Cd in the waters and biota may be higher than in waters and related species of organisms from polluted coastal areas. Like the Southern Ocean, Antarctic lakes have many peculiar characteristics. They are often perennially ice covered and without outlet, and their water, which is gained only from short-term melting of snow and glaciers in summer, is lost mainly by sublimation of surface ice. Several lakes are distinctly stratified: the water under the ice may be cool, rich in oxygen, and among the cleanest and clearest of natural waters, whereas water near the bottom becomes anoxic, tepid, and richer in major and trace elements. Considering the specificity of Antarctic environments, to evaluate the extent and consequences of global changes and increasing human activities in Antarctica itself, research on the biogeochemistry of trace metals and monitoring progr","Bargagli, R",2,1,pp.129-173,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART09024196,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART09024196&type=mobile,,,climate change Antarctica

Recent years have seen the emergence of large-scale mechanistic explanations&#x2013;or “paradigms of change”&#x2013;that attempt to synthesize our understanding of past and current changes. In many cases, these paradigms are based on observations that are spatially and temporally patchy. The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of Earth’s most rapidly changing regions, has been an area of particular research focus. A recently proposed mechanistic explanation for observed changes in the WAP region relates changes in penguin populations to variability in krill biomass and regional warming. While this scheme is attractive for its simplicity and chronology, it may not account for complex spatio-temporal processes that drive ecosystem dynamics in the region. It might also be difficult to apply to other Antarctic regions that are experiencing some, though not all, of the changes documented for the WAP. We use qualitative network models of differing levels of complexity to test paradigms of change for the WAP ecosystem. Importantly, our approach captures the emergent effects of feedback processes in complex ecological networks and provides a means to identify and incorporate uncertain linkages between network elements. Our findings highlight key areas of uncertainty in the drivers of documented trends, and suggest that a greater level of model complexity is needed in devising explanations for ecosystem change in the Southern Ocean. We suggest that our network approach to evaluating a recent and widely cited paradigm of change for the Antarctic region could be broadly applied in hypothesis testing for other regions and research fields.</P>","Melbourne-Thomas, Jessica;Constable, Andrew;Wotherspoon, Simon;Raymond, Ben;",2,1,pp.e55093,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0055093,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART87599913,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART87599913&type=mobile,,,climate change Antarctica

Generally, flux changes are dominated by increased atmospheric moisture due to temperature increase in the future climate projections. An approach is presented to distinguish between thermodynamical and dynamical influences on moisture flux. Furthermore, a physical interpretation of the transport changes due to dynamics is investigated by decomposing atmospheric waves into different length scales and temporal variations. Signals of moisture flux are compared with fluctuations of geopotential height fields as well as climate signals of extratropical cyclones. Moisture flux variability in the synoptic length scale with temporal variations shorter than 8 days can be assigned to the SH storm track. Climate change signals of these atmospheric waves show a distinctive poleward shift. This can be attributed to the climate change signal of extratropical cyclones. Furthermore, the climate change signal of atmospheric waves can be better understood if strong cyclones that intensify especially on the Eastern Hemisphere are taken into account. Antarctic net precipitation is calculated by means of the vertically integrated moisture flux. Future projections show increasing signals of net precipitation, whereas the dynamical part of net precipitation decreases. This can be understood by means of the low-variability component of synoptic-scale waves, which show a decreasing signal, especially off the coast of West Antarctica. This is shown to be due to changing variability of the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas low.</P>","Grieger, Jens;Leckebusch, Gregor C.;Ulbrich, Uwe;",2,1,pp.907-924,https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-14-00787.1,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART107290474,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART107290474&type=mobile,,,climate change Antarctica

Lake levels rose 15m over the past 68years in response to climate-driven variability in ice-cover sublimation, meltwater production, and annual discharge of the Onyx River, the main source of water to the lake. Evidence from a new bathymetric map and water balance model combined with annual growth laminations in benthic mats suggest that the most recent filling trend began abruptly 80years ago, in the early 1930s. This change increased lake volume by >50%, triggered the formation of a new, upper, thermohaline convection cell, and cooled the lower convection cell by at least 2<SUP>o</SUP>C and the bottom-most waters by at >4<SUP>o</SUP>C. Additionally, the depth of the deep chlorophyll a maximum rose by >2m, and deep-growing benthic algal mats declined while shallow benthic mats colonized freshly inundated areas. We attribute changes in hydrology to regional variations in air flow related to the strength and position of the Amundsen Sea Low (ASL) pressure system which have increased the frequency of down-valley, fohn winds associated with surface air temperature warming in the McMurdo Dry Valleys. The ASL has also been implicated in the recent warming of the Antarctic Peninsula, and provides a common link for climate-related change on opposite sides of the continent. If this trend persists, Lake Vanda should continue to rise and cool over the next 200years until a new equilibrium lake level is achieved. Most likely, future lake rise will lead to isothermal conditions not conducive to thermohaline convection, resulting in a drastically different physical, biogeochemical, and biological structure than observed today.","Castendyk, D.N.;Obryk, M.K.;Leidman, S.Z.;Gooseff, M.;Hawes, I.;",2,1,pp.213-227,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.06.007,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76238903,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76238903&type=mobile,Lake level rise .

In this study, extensive data of marine Ariake clays are obtained to investigate the gravitational compression behavior for sensitive clays. Analysis results indicate that the compression behavior of remolded Ariake clays is not different from that of other remolded/reconstituted soils. But natural Ariake clays do not follow the gravitational compression pattern reported by Skempton (1970) for natural sedimentary soils. At a given value of effective overburden pressure, the void ratios of natural Ariake clays are almost independent of liquid limits. Most natural Ariake clays lie above the sedimentation compression line proposed by Burland (1990). When the liquid limit is larger than 90% and the ratio of natural water content over liquid limit ranges 0.8&ndash;1.1, the natural Ariake clays lie around the sedimentation compression line. In addition, the natural Ariake clay with higher value of the ratio of natural water content over liquid limit lies above the natural Ariake clay with lower value of the ratio of natural water content over liquid limit.

Test and calcite flux rates are calculated according to the distribution of species obtained from multinet and sediment trap samples. Modern planktic foraminiferal population dynamics are discussed as a prerequisite for the quantification of the calcite budget, highlighting the importance of ecological, autecological (e.g., reproduction), and biogeochemical conditions that determine the presence or absence of species. To complete the open&#x2010;marine, particulate CaCO3 inventory, the contribution of coccolithophores, pteropods, and calcareous dinophytes is discussed. Based on the studied regions, the global planktic foraminiferal calcite flux rate at 100 m depth amounts to 1.3-3.2 Gt yr<SUP>&#x2212;1</SUP>, equivalent to 23-56% of the total open marine CaCO3 flux. The preservation of tests varies on a regional and temporal scale, and is affected by local hydrography and dissolution. During most of the year (off&#x2010;peak periods), many tests dissolve above 700&#x2010;m water depth while settling through the water column, with on average only 1-3% of the initially exported CaCO3 reaching the deep&#x2010;seafloor.

Because the program is interdisciplinary in nature, specialized results of import in biology and physical oceanography for example have been published elsewhere. This volume represents the early, site-descriptive results from the program. While many of the results are descriptive, considerable effort has been made by the authors to show the implications for understanding of marine sedimentological processes. The objective of this final paper is to summarize these results and implications and on occasion add our own personal interpretation in an attempt to obtain for the reader a greater synthesis of the project.The organization of the HEBBLE project is largely reflected in the resultant organization of the major sections in this volume. Most of the results here focus on the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the HEBBLE site, with some attention being paid to the characteristics of the biological community at the site as needed to refine a truly marine sediment transport model. The success of estimating the deposition rate and of relating the bed modification and deposition dynamics to fluid forcing by the boundary layer are the key goals for the next two years. The results on the characteristics of the suspended sediment show that much information can be obtained by careful and repeated sampling of material, if the results are placed in their appropriate fluid mechanical setting (see McCave, this volume).The key implication of the field observations and laboratory and theoretical studies relates to the generation of longitudinal ripples. Of greatest import is the conclusion that such features are depositional; thus we are looking at bedforms that may well be preserved into the stratigraphic record. But if longitudinal ripples are depositional, then one of the cornerstones in discriminating between turbidites and contourites is now removed. Turbidites are preserved because of the rapid and high rate of local downslope deposition. Longitudinal ripples may likely be produced from the waning period of a storm when extreme rates of deposition occur; without knowing the local slope it may well be impossible to discriminate between turbidite and contourite deposits.","Nowell, A.R.M.;McCave, I.N.;Hollister, C.D.;",2,1,pp.397-409,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0025-3227(85)90041-6,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17379295,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17379295&type=mobile,,,marine sedimentation

Differences in environments and depositional processes during the last glacial and postglacial epochs were investigated using X-rays and volume magnetic susceptibility (VMS). Further analyses included bulk and clay mineral composition, micropalaeontological studies (both benthic and planktic foraminifera) and radiometric dating. We compare our sedimentological, geochemical (organic carbon and nitrogen content), and geotechnical (shear strength and water content) results to those on cores previously taken from the region. These analyses suggest that prior to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a glacial marine diamicton (<37,000 yr BP uncorrected age) was deposited across the basin from beneath an expanded Ross ice shelf that was grounded on the basin flanks. Sediment gravity flow deposits (27,000&ndash;21,000 yr BP uncorrected ages) that overlie the diamicton in the deepest part of the southernmost area of the basin are interpreted to have been deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum (&sim;18,000 yr BP) as remobilized subglacial diamicton from the flanks of the basin, initiated by the movement of grounded ice. These sediments are followed by a period of non-deposition caused by basin starvation after retreat of the grounding line of Ross Sea ice far to the south. As a consequence, terrigenous supply was limited, and the persistence of floating shelf ice followed by multi-year sea-ice coverage inhibited the biogenic activity.

We first review different models of the FCN resonance parameters (period, damping, strength), as well as different inversion techniques used in gravimetry (analytical, linearised least squares, non-linear generalised inverse, stochastic). We propose then a new Bayesian inversion method since such a probabilistic view allows the most complete and reliable information on the FCN resonance to be obtained. We show the consequences of introducing the positivity of the quality factor <I>Q</I> and, even more important, we show that the null information criterion on this factor allows us to better understand why <I>Q</I> is often underestimated in gravity studies (or even found to be negative) with standard least squares techniques. We apply the Bayesian estimation method to a set of gravity data originating from a 3000-day record (1988&#x2013;1996) of the superconducting gravimeter (SG T005) near Strasbourg (France), after correction for pressure effects and ocean loading with the help of a recent model derived from satellite altimetry. The marginal distribution found for the eigenperiod is nearly Gaussian and leads to a most probable value of 428 days, in agreement with previous gravity studies. The <I>Q</I> distribution is found to be highly asymmetrical with a flat maximum probability that <I>Q</I> exceeds 10<SUP>5</SUP>, in agreement with the high values derived from very large baseline interferometry (VLBI) studies. The joint probability laws of the parameters show that strong correlations exist between some couples of parameters. Finally, the important impact of inaccurate ocean loading corrections on the determination of the damping of the eigenmode is pointed out; it appears that wrong ocean corrections may lead to underestimation of <I>Q</I> or, even worse, to generation of negative <I>Q</I> when using standard least squares retrieval techniques applied to gravity data.</P>","Florsch, Nicolas;Hinderer, Jacques;",2,1,pp.21-35,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0031-9201(99)00084-9,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART08209375,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART08209375&type=mobile,Bayesian .

Despite the health and environmental benefits of the inorganic binders, wider commercial use requires ongoing technical improvements to address some potential inherent limitations of this technology. Considering that inorganic cores can suffer from storage stability, this study sets out to check whether inorganic core binders are fit to replace organic ones in producing a gravity diecasting Al alloy component. First, the humidity resistance of both organic and inorganic sand cores, within a typical time-frame storage in the foundry, was evaluated by moisture absorption tests. Then, 3D optical measurements were performed to assess the relative dimensional changes of inorganic cores. Last, the influence of the core system was analyzed through microstructural and mechanical investigations on castings manufactured by using organic and inorganic binders. The experimental findings have shown that the moisture absorption during storage in the foundry warehouse, which lasted up to 14 days, was not enough to jeopardize the functionality of the cores. Furthermore, the tensile and microstructural outcomes revealed that inorganic cores could comply with both high component design requirements and even more stringent environmental regulations of foundries.</P></P>","Fortini, A.;Merlin, M.;Raminella, G.;",2,1,pp.674-688,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40962-021-00628-1,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART118746010,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART118746010&type=mobile,,,gravity core analysis

Therefore local damage to members and joints may occur. In this study, a 60-story straight structure and a structure with 12.7 degree-tilted mid-stories to X-axis were modeled to analyze the behavior of models. Linear static analysis was performed to investigate the story drift ratios and the member forces of column and core as the core of the tilted structure moves along the X-axis. The applied load combinations are equivalent static seismic load and gravity load. As a result of the analysis, in the tilted structure, the effect of gravity load was dominant rather than seismic load unlike the straight structure. In addition, as the core moved along the X-axis, the story drift ratio, the axial force of the column, and the area of the core under the tensile force decreased in the load combination including the gravity load. Therefore, it is judged that the core moves along the X-axis is advantageous for structure overturning.

No regional or seed source differences were found for the age of transition or rate of change from juvenile to mature wood specific gravity with an analysis of variance 'F' test. However, contrasts for groups of provenance regions defined on the basis of broad geographic characteristics showed transition ages were earlier for regions west of the Mississippi (12.0-12.3 yr) when compared to eastern regions (12.6-13.0 yr). Variation in whole core specific gravity and juvenile and mature wood core specific gravity was significant on a source and regional basis. No regional or source differences were found for percent summerwood. Specific gravity was highest in the lost pines source, followed by sources from the northwest and northeast portions of the loblolly pine range, and lowest for sources from the gulf coast and interior portions of the loblolly range. Contrasts for groups of provenance regions reflect similar results for all specific gravity traits. Percent summerwood, whole core specific gravity, and juvenile and mature wood core specific gravity had negative phenotypic correlations with transition age. Whole tree specific gravity, basal area, and percent summerwood had positive phenotypic correlations with estimated core specific gravity. For.

The six cases of possible gravity-injection paths from the refueling water tank (RWT) were identified and the thermal-hydraulic analyses were performed using the RELAP5/MOD3.2 code. The core cooling capability was significantly dependent on the gravity-injection path, the RCS opening, and the injection rate. In the cases with the pressurizer manway opening higher than the RWT water level, the coolant was held up in the pressurizer and the system pressure continued increasing after gravity-injection. The gravity injection eventually stopped due to the high system pressure and the core was uncovered. In the cases with the injection path and opening on the same leg side, the core cooling was dependent on whether the water injected from the RWT passed the core region or not. However, in the cases with the injection path and opening on the different leg side, the system was well depressurized after gravity-injection and the core boiling was successfully prevented for a long-term transient. In addition, from the sensitivity study on the gravity-injection flow rate, it was found that about 54 kg/s of injection rate was required to maintain the core cooling and the core cooling could be provided for about 10.6 hours after event with that injection rate from the RWT. Those analysis results would provide useful information to operators coping with the event.","Seul, Kwang-Woo;Bang, Young-Seok;Kim, Hho-Jung;",2,1,pp.476-485,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIFullTextView?cn=JAKO199911921633081&dbt=JAKO&keyValue=05787966,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO199911921633081,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO199911921633081&type=mobile,loss-of-shutdown-cooling event . gravity-injection core cooling .

Even with existing information, including seismic measurements from the Apollo mission, as well as geodetic measurements from Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data and gravity, it is still difficult to constrain the size of the lunar core and its density with certainty. Here, we investigate the radius and density of the lunar core using simple constraints of the estimated mean density and mean moment of inertia of the Moon with the help of a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm. This includes a comparison between the results based from the more recent GRAIL gravity field model GRGM660PRIM with those of the gravity field model SGM100h. Analysis through an improved gravity field model indicates that the lunar core is smaller and denser than previously estimated, and the result (a core radius with 370km) is consistent with more recent result.","Yan, J.;Xu, L.;Li, F.;Matsumoto, K.;Rodriguez, J.A.P.;Miyamoto, H.;Dohm, J.M.;",2,1,pp.1721-1727,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2014.12.038,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART71428180,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART71428180&type=mobile,Lunar core radius .

The Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field, originating mainly within the core, and its temporal variations can be used to infer the fluid motion at the top of the core, on a decadal and subdecadal time-scale. Gravity variations resulting from changes in the mass distribution within the Earth may also occur on the same time-scales. Such variations include the signature of the flow inside the core, though they are largely dominated by the water cycle contributions. Our study is based on 8 y of high-resolution, high-accuracy magnetic and gravity satellite data, provided by the CHAMP and GRACE missions. From the newly derived geomagnetic models we have computed the core magnetic field, its temporal variations, and the core flow evolution. From the GRACE CNES/GRGS series of time variable geoid models, we have obtained interannual gravity models by using specifically designed postprocessing techniques. A correlation analysis between the magnetic and gravity series has demonstrated that the interannual changes in the second time derivative of the core magnetic field under a region from the Atlantic to Indian Ocean coincide in phase with changes in the gravity field. The order of magnitude of these changes and proposed correlation are plausible, compatible with a core origin; however, a complete theoretical model remains to be built.
