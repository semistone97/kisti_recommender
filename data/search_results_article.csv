Increasing paleoclimatic evidence suggests that the Little Ice Age (LIA) was a global climate change event. Understanding the forcings and associated climate system feedbacks of the LIA is made difficult by the scarcity of Southern Hemisphere paleoclimate records. We use a new glaciochemical record of a coastal ice core from Mt. Erebus Saddle, Antarctica, to reconstruct atmospheric and oceanic conditions in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica over the past five centuries. The LIA is identified in stable isotope (&delta;D) and lithophile element records, which respectively demonstrate that the region experienced 1.6 ± 1.4 &deg;C cooler average temperatures prior to 1850 AD than during the last 150 yr and strong (>57 m s&#x2212;1) prevailing katabatic winds between 1500 and 1800 AD. Al and Ti concentration increases of an order of magnitude (>120 ppb Al) are linked to enhanced aeolian transport of complex silicate minerals and represent the strongest katabatic wind events of the LIA. These events are associated with three 12-30 yr intervals of cooler temperatures at ca. 1690 AD, 1770 AD and 1840 AD. Furthermore, ice core concentrations of the biogenic sulphur species MS&#x2212; suggest that biological productivity in the Ross Sea polynya was ~80% higher prior to 1875 AD than at any subsequent time.

We demonstrate a causal association between the El Ni&ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the frequency of oceanic/West Antarctic trajectories originating from the Ross Sea and Amundsen Sea regions. In contrast, we find that the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) has little influence on the trajectory cluster frequencies. We then develop proxy records for synoptic variability using a shallow firn core from Gawn Ice Piedmont in Southern Victoria Land. Continental/East Antarctic trajectory frequency correlates with concentrations of nitrate (NO3), which is sourced from stratospheric air&#x2010;masses descending over the Antarctic interior. At seasonal to inter&#x2010;annual scales, the frequency of oceanic/West Antarctic trajectory clusters strongly correlate with deuterium excess, which is sensitive to changes in relative humidity and sea surface temperature in the Ross and Amundsen Seas.

The Little Ice Age (LIA) is the most recent abrupt climate change event. Understanding its forcings and associated climate system feedbacks is made difficult by a scarcity of Southern Hemisphere paleoclimate records. In this paper we utilise ice core glaciochemical records to reconstruct atmospheric and oceanic conditions in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctic, a region influenced by two contrasting meteorological regimes: katabatic winds and cyclones. Stable isotope (&delta;D) and lithophile element concentration (e.g., Al) records indicate that the region experienced ~1.75 &deg;C cooler temperatures and strong (&amp;gt;57 m s&#x2212;1) prevailing katabatic winds during the LIA. We observe that the 1590-1875 record is characterised by high d-excess values and marine element (e.g., Na) concentrations, which are linked to the intrusion of cyclonic systems. The strongest katabatic wind events of the LIA, marked by Al, Ti and Pb concentration increases of an order of magnitude (&amp;gt;120 ppb Al), also occur during this interval. Furthermore, concentrations of the biogenic sulphur species MS&#x2212; suggest that biological productivity in the Ross Sea Polynya was ~80% higher prior to 1875 than in the subsequent time. We propose that colder temperatures and intensified cyclonic activity in the Ross Sea promoted stronger katabatic winds across the Ross Ice Shelf, resulting in an enlarged polynya with increased sea ice and bottom water production. It is therefore hypothesised that increased bottom water formation during the LIA occurred in response to atmospheric circulation change. </P>","Rhodes, R. H.;Bertler, N. A. N.;Baker, J.

Data from seismic reflection surveys and drill sites from Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 28 and International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374, located across the present-day middle continental shelf of the central Ross Sea (Antarctica), indicate the presence of expanded early to middle Miocene sedimentary sections. These include the Miocene climate optimum (MCO ca. 17-14.6 Ma) and the middle Miocene climate transition (MMCT ca. 14.6-13.9 Ma). Here, we correlate drill core records, wireline logs and reflection seismic data to elucidate the depositional architecture of the continental shelf and reconstruct the evolution and variability of dynamic ice sheets in the Ross Sea during the Miocene. Drill-site data are used to constrain seismic isopach maps that document the evolution of different ice sheets and ice caps which influenced sedimentary processes in the Ross Sea through the early to middle Miocene. In the early Miocene, periods of localized advance of the ice margin are revealed by the formation of thick sediment wedges prograding into the basins. At this time, morainal bank complexes are distinguished along the basin margins suggesting sediment supply derived from marine-terminating glaciers. During the MCO, biosiliceous-bearing sediments are regionally mapped within the depocenters of the major sedimentary basin across the Ross Sea, indicative of widespread open marine deposition with reduced glacimarine influence. At the MMCT, a distinct erosive surface is interpreted as representing large-scale marine-based ice sheet advance over most of the Ross Sea paleo-continental shelf. The regional mapping of the seismic stratigraphic architecture and its correlation to drilling data indicate a regional transition through the Miocene from growth of ice caps and inland ice sheets with marine-terminating margins, to widespread marine-based ice sheets extending across the outer continental shelf in the Ross Sea.</P></P>","P&eacute;rez, Lara F.;Santis, Laura De;McKay, Robert M.;Larter, Robert D.;Ash, Jeanine;Bart, Phil J.;B&ouml;hm, Gualtiero;Brancatelli, Giuseppe;Browne, Imogen;Colleoni, Florence;Dodd, Justin P.;Geletti, Riccardo;Harwood, David M.;Kuhn, Gerhard;Laberg, Jan Sverre;Leckie, R.

The sedimentary clasts in AND-2A are divided into seven distinct petrofacies. A comparison of these with potential source rocks from the Transantarctic Mountains and the coastal Southern Victoria Land suggests that the majority of the sedimentary clasts were derived from formations within the Devonian-Triassic Beacon Supergroup. The siliciclastic-carbonate petrofacies are similar to the fossiliferous erratics found in the Quaternary Moraine in the southern McMurdo Sound and were probably sourced from Eocene strata that are currently hidden beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. Intraformational clasts were almost certainly reworked from diamictite and mudstone sequences that were originally deposited proximal to the drill site. The distribution of sedimentary gravel clasts in AND-2A suggests that sedimentary sequences in the drill core were deposited under two main glacial scenarios: 1) a highly dynamic ice sheet that did not extend beyond the coastal margin and produced abundant debris-rich icebergs from outlet glaciers in the central Transantarctic Mountains and South Victoria Land; 2) and an ice sheet that extended well beyond the coastal margin and periodically advanced across the Ross Embayment. Glacial scenario 1 dominated the early to mid-Miocene (between ca. 1000 and 225mbsf in AND-2A) and scenario 2 the early Miocene (between ca. 1138 and 1000mbsf) and late Neogene to Holocene (above ca. 225mbsf).

Varying sedimentary facies in the 1285m core indicate glacial-interglacial cyclicity with the proximity of ice at the site ranging from grounding of ice in 917m of water to ice free marine conditions. Broader interpretation of climatic conditions of the wider Ross Sea Embayment is deduced from provenance studies. Here we present an analysis of the iron oxide assemblages in the AND-1B core and interpret their variability with respect to wider paleoclimatic conditions. The core is naturally divided into an upper and lower succession by an expanded 170m thick volcanic interval between 590 and 760m. Above 590m the Plio-Pleistocene glacial cycles are diatom rich and below 760m late Miocene glacial cycles are terrigenous. Electron microscopy and rock magnetic parameters confirm the subdivision with biogenic silica diluting the terrigenous input (fine pseudo-single domain and stable single domain titanomagnetite from the McMurdo Volcanic Group with a variety of textures and compositions) above 590m. Below 760m, the Miocene section consists of coarse-grained ilmenite and multidomain magnetite derived from Transantarctic Mountain lithologies. This may reflect ice flow patterns and the absence of McMurdo Volcanic Group volcanic centers or indicate that volcanic centers had not yet grown to a significant size. The combined rock magnetic and electron microscopy signatures of magnetic minerals serve as provenance tracers in both ice proximal and distal sedimentary units, aiding in the study of ice sheet extent and dynamics, and the identification of ice rafted debris sources and dispersal patterns in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica.","Brachfeld, S.;Pinzon, J.;Darley, J.;Sagnotti, L.;Kuhn, G.;Florindo, F.;Wilson, G.;Ohneiser, C.;Monien, D.;Joseph, L.;",2,1,pp.420-433,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2013.09.015,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART68181695,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART68181695&type=mobile,electron microscopy .

This is critical in terms of understanding the seasonality, source regions, and transport pathways of precipitation delivered to these sites. In situ snow depth and meteorological observations are used to identify major accumulation events in 2007-2008, which differ considerably between sites in terms of their magnitude and seasonal distribution. While snowfall at Evans Piedmont Glacier occurs almost exclusively during summer and spring, Skinner Saddle receives precipitation year round with a lull during the months of April and May. Cluster analysis of daily back trajectories reveals that the highest&#x2010;accumulation days at both sites result from fast&#x2010;moving air masses, associated with synoptic&#x2010;scale low&#x2010;pressure systems. There is evidence that short&#x2010;duration pulses of snowfall at SKS also originate from mesocyclone development over the Ross Ice Shelf and local moisture sources.

During the Late Pleistocene-Holocene, the Ross Sea Ice Shelf exhibited strong spatial variability in relation to the atmospheric and oceanographic climatic variations. Despite being thoroughly investigated, the timing of the ice sheet retreat from the outer continental shelf since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) still remains controversial, mainly due to a lack of sediment cores with a robust chronostratigraphy. For this reason, the recent recovery of sediments containing a continuous occurrence of calcareous foraminifera provides the important opportunity to create a reliable age model and document the early deglacial phase in particular. Here we present a multiproxy study from a sediment core collected at the Hallett Ridge (1800 m of depth), where significant occurrences of calcareous planktonic and benthic foraminifera allow us to document the first evidence of the deglaciation after the LGM at about 20.2 ka. Our results suggest that the co-occurrence of large Neogloboquadrina pachyderma tests and abundant juvenile forms reflects the beginning of open-water conditions and coverage of seasonal sea ice. Our multiproxy approach based on diatoms, silicoflagellates, carbon and oxygen stable isotopes on N. pachyderma, sediment texture, and geochemistry indicates that abrupt warming occurred at approximately 17.8 ka, followed by a period of increasing biological productivity. During the Holocene, the exclusive dominance of agglutinated benthic foraminifera suggests that dissolution was the main controlling factor on calcareous test accumulation and preservation. Diatoms and silicoflagellates show that ocean conditions were variable during the middle Holocene and the beginning of the Neoglacial period at around 4 ka. In the Neoglacial, an increase in sand content testifies to a strengthening of bottom-water currents, supported by an increase in the abundance of the tycopelagic fossil diatom Paralia sulcata transported from the coastal regions, while an increase in ice-rafted debris suggests more glacial transport by icebergs. </P>","Melis, Romana;Capotondi, Lucilla;Torricella, Fiorenza;Ferretti, Patrizia;Geniram, Andrea;Hong, Jong Kuk;Kuhn, Gerhard;Khim, Boo-Keun;Kim, Sookwan;Malinverno, Elisa;Yoo, Kyu Cheul;Colizza, Ester;",2,1,pp.15-35,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/jm-40-15-2021,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART113315483,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART113315483&type=mobile,,,Ross Sea core

However, there are no circumpolar assessments of available habitat for larval krill, making it difficult to evaluate how climate change may impact this life stage. We use outputs from a circumpolar sea ice model, together with a set of simple assumptions regarding key habitat features, to identify possible regions of larval krill habitat around Antarctica during winter. We assume that the location and suitability of habitat is determined by both food availability and three&#8208;dimensional complexity of the sea ice. A comparison of the combined area of these regions under current conditions with a warm climate scenario indicates that while total areal sea ice extent decreases, there is a consistently larger area of potential larval krill habitat under warm conditions.

Shelf water formation in the Mertz Glacier Polynya is a major source of Ad&eacute;lie Land Bottom Water. Coupled ocean and sea ice model simulations for 1996-1999 span a transitional period of the system: The 1996-1997 strong polynya state is characterized by high sea ice growth and export, ocean to atmosphere heat flux, shelf water density, and rate of dense water export; in the 1998-1999 weak polynya state all these quantities are greatly reduced. The 1990s interannual variability in air temperature and precipitation is of similar magnitude to future increases as projected for the Southern Ocean by the IPCC assessment. We model the polynya with perturbed climate change forcing and find that the system shows a reduction in shelf water export in both the strong/weak modes. Overall, the dense water export is reduced by 40% for a 2&deg;C surface warming, and by 33% for a 20 cm a<SUP>&#x2212;1</SUP> precipitation increase. In the weak polynya state that is more likely in future climate, shelf water export is reduced by 81% for the warming and by 65% for the freshening.

Climate over this and earlier periods has not been stable, as evidenced by the occurrence of abrupt changes in atmospheric circulation and temperature recorded in Antarctic ice core proxies for past climate. Two of the most prominent abrupt climate change events are characterized by intensification of the circumpolar westerlies (also known as the Southern Annular Mode) between &sim;6000 and 5000 years ago and since 1200-1000 years ago. Following the last of these is a period of major trans&#x2010;Antarctic reorganization of atmospheric circulation and temperature between A.D. 1700 and 1850. The two earlier Antarctic abrupt climate change events appear linked to but predate by several centuries even more abrupt climate change in the North Atlantic, and the end of the more recent event is coincident with reorganization of atmospheric circulation in the North Pacific. Improved understanding of such events and of the associations between abrupt climate change events recorded in both hemispheres is critical to predicting the impact and timing of future abrupt climate change events potentially forced by anthropogenic changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols. Special attention is given to the climate of the past 200 years, which was recorded by a network of recently available shallow firn cores, and to that of the past 50 years, which was monitored by the continuous instrumental record. Significant regional climate changes have taken place in the Antarctic during the past 50 years. Atmospheric temperatures have increased markedly over the Antarctic Peninsula, linked to nearby ocean warming and intensification of the circumpolar westerlies. Glaciers are retreating on the peninsula, in Patagonia, on the sub&#x2010;Antarctic islands, and in West Antarctica adjacent to the peninsula. The penetration of marine air masses has become more pronounced over parts of West Antarctica. Above the surface, the Antarctic troposphere has warmed during winter while the stratosphere has cooled year&#x2010;round. The upper kilometer of the circumpolar Southern Ocean has warmed, Antarctic Bottom Water across a wide sector off East Antarctica has freshened, and the densest bottom water in the Weddell Sea has warmed. In contrast to these regional climate changes, over most of Antarctica, near&#x2010;surface temperature and snowfall have not increased significantly during at least the past 50 years, and proxy data suggest that the atmospheric circulation over the interior has remained in a similar state for at least the past 200 years. Furthermore, the total sea ice cover around Antarctica has exhibited no significant overall change since reliable satellite monitoring began in the late 1970s, despite large but compensating regional changes. The inhomogeneity of Antarctic climate in space and time implies that recent Antarctic climate changes are due on the one hand to a combination of strong multidecadal variability and anthropogenic effects and, as demonstrated by the paleoclimate record, on the other hand to multidecadal to millennial scale and longer natural variability forced through changes in orbital insolation, greenhouse gases, solar variability, ice dynamics, and aerosols. Model projections suggest that over the 21st century the Antarctic interior will warm by 3.4&deg; ± 1&deg;C, and sea ice extent will decrease by &sim;30%. Ice sheet models are not yet adequate enough to answer pressing questions about the effect of projected warming on mass balance and sea level. Considering the potentially major impacts of a warming climate on Antarctica, vigorous efforts are needed to better understand all aspects of the highly coupled Antarctic climate system as well as its influence on the Earth's climate and oceans.</P>","Mayewski, P.

These plants have been studied for decades and recognized as bioindicators of the climate change. The article presents preliminary studies and results of a thermal actuator, which is going to be applied in a climate change studies. The elaborated, far infrared actuator together with a control system maintains the temperature of the Antarctic plant certain delta above the ambient temperature. Since the heat transfer is based on infrared radiation a thermal model is introduced, where the parameters of the model are determined empirically approximating it using a 1-st order dynamical system. Once determined, the sytem model paremeters help to design the control strategies: Control On-Off (1) and Control PID (proportional&#x2013;integral&#x2013;derivative) (2). As a result we obtain that the control PID maintains the objects temperature with major stability than On-Off, what makes it preferable in the final application.

However, until recently continental Antarctica appeared to be little impacted by climate warming, thus biological changes were predicted to be relatively slow. Detecting the biological effects of Antarctic climate change has been hindered by the paucity of long&#8208;term data sets, particularly for organisms that have been exposed to these changes throughout their lives. We show that radiocarbon signals are preserved along shoots of the dominant Antarctic moss flora and use these to determine accurate growth rates over a period of several decades, allowing us to explore the influence of environmental variables on growth and providing a dramatic demonstration of the effects of climate change. We have generated detailed 50&#8208;year growth records for <I>C</I><I>eratodon purpureus</I> and three other Antarctic moss species using the 1960s radiocarbon bomb spike.

Climate change will alter the extent and configuration of ice-free areas, yet the distribution and severity of these effects remain unclear. Here we quantify the impact of twenty-first century climate change on ice-free areas under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate forcing scenarios using temperature-index melt modelling. Under the strongest forcing scenario, ice-free areas could expand by over 17,000&thinsp;km<SUP>2</SUP> by the end of the century, close to a 25% increase. Most of this expansion will occur in the Antarctic Peninsula, where a threefold increase in ice-free area could drastically change the availability and connectivity of biodiversity habitat. Isolated ice-free areas will coalesce, and while the effects on biodiversity are uncertain, we hypothesize that they could eventually lead to increasing regional-scale biotic homogenization, the extinction of less-competitive species and the spread of invasive species.","Lee, Jasmine R.;Raymond, Ben;Bracegirdle, Thomas J.;Chad&egrave;s, Iadine;Fuller, Richard A.;Shaw, Justine D.;Terauds, Aleks;",2,1,pp.49-54,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature22996,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART78274102,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART78274102&type=mobile,,,Antarctic climate

Core flows also lead to a gravity change through the global elastic deformations that accompany changes in the non-hydrostatic pressure at the core&ndash;mantle boundary (CMB). In this work, we present predictions of the gravity changes from these two processes during the past century. These predictions are built on the basis of flows at the surface of the core that are reconstructed from the observed geomagnetic secular variation. The pressure-induced gravity variations can be reconstructed directly from surface core flows under the assumption of tangential geostrophy; predicted variations in the Stokes coefficients of degree 2, 3 and 4 are of the order of 10<SUP>&minus;11</SUP>, 3 &times; 10<SUP>&minus;12</SUP> and 10<SUP>&minus;12</SUP>, respectively, with a typical timescale of a few decades. These correspond to changes in gravity of 70, 30 and 15 nGal, and to equivalent geoid height variations of 0.15, 0.05 and 0.02 mm, respectively. The density-induced gravity variations cannot be determined solely from surface core flows, though a partial recovery is possible if flows with important axial gradients dominate the dynamics at decadal timescales. If this is the case, the density-induced gravity signal is of similar amplitude and generally anti-correlated with the pressure-induced signal, thus reducing the overall amplitude of the gravity changes. However, because we expect decadal flows to be predominantly axially invariant, the amplitude of the density-induced gravity changes should be much smaller. Our prediction also allows to determine upper bounds in pressure change at the CMB and density change within the core that have taken place during the past 20 yr such that observed gravity variations are not exceeded; for harmonic degree 2, we find a maximum pressure change of approximately 350 Pa and a maximum departure from hydrostatic density of approximately 1 part in 10<SUP>7</SUP>. Although the predicted gravity changes from core flows are small, they are at the threshold of detectability with high-precision gravity measurements from satellite missions such as GRACE. The most important challenge to identifying a core signal will be the removal of interannual gravity variations caused by surface processes which are an order of magnitude larger and mask the core signal.</P>","Dumberry, Mathieu",2,1,pp.635-650,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04437.x,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART51982688,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART51982688&type=mobile,"Gravity anomalies and Earth structure .

Silica beads were first functionalized using two different green strategies, grafting to (MPS/ EtOH in scCO2) and grafting from (plasma technology). These core beads were then used as seed particles in the synthesis, in scCO2 of a MIP layer. Dynamic binding tests were performed in order to evaluate the affinity of the resulting silica core – MIP shell beads to ACET and the efficiency of its removal from an active pharmaceutical ingredient – Beclomomethasone dipropionate (API) crude mixture. ACET was preferentially retained over analogue molecules, benzamide (BENZ) and pivalamide (PIV). The core–shell MIP beads were packed in a SPE column (396.5 mg in a 3 mL SPE tube) and evaluated as a potential gravity-driven purification device, enabling the removal of 100% of ACET whilst losing only 0.37% of API from a model mixture solution—10 mL of ACET and API (0.25 mg mL1 + 3.5 mg mL1).",Raquel Viveiros;Francisco M.

This occurs through the advection of density anomalies within the volume of the liquid core and by deformation of the solid boundaries of the mantle and inner core which feature density contrasts. It also occurs through torques acting on the inner core reorienting its non-spherical shape. These in situ mass changes lead to global gravity variations, and global deformations (inducing additional gravity variations) occur in order to maintain the mechanical equilibrium of the whole Earth. Changes in Earth&rsquo;s rotation vector (and thus of the global centrifugal potential) induced by core flows are an additional source of global deformations and associated gravity changes originating from core dynamics. Here, we review how each of these different core processes operates, how gravity changes and ground deformations from each could be reconstructed, as well as ways to estimate their amplitudes. Based on our current understanding of core dynamics, we show that, at spherical harmonic degree 2, core processes contribute to gravity variations and ground deformations that are approximately a factor 10 smaller than those observed and caused by dynamical processes within the fluid layers at the Earth&rsquo;s surface. The larger the harmonic degree, the smaller is the contribution from the core.

The precession of a triaxial inner core with a different density than the fluid core induces a periodic gravity variation of degree 2, order 1. Elastic deformations from the pressure that the precessing fluid core exerts on the core&#x2010;mantle boundary also contribute to this gravity signal.

However, we do not have firm evidence for the presence of a solid inner core in any planetary body other than Earth. In this study, we present a method that would permit a possible detection of Mercury's solid inner core. The idea exploits Mercury's rotational state: as seen by an observer on Mercury's crust, the solid inner core executes a retrograde precession motion at a period of 58.646 days. Since there is a density contrast at the interface between the solid and fluid core, this precession motion induces a time&#x2010;dependent gravity signal. A future satellite mission that could measure the gravity field of Mercury with sufficient precision could detect this signal, and confirm the presence of a central, solid inner core.

The motions of the liquid within the Earth's outer core lead to magnetic field variations together with mass distribution changes. As the core is not accessible for direct observation, our knowledge of the Earth&rsquo;s liquid core dynamics only relies on indirect information sources. Mainly generated by the core dynamics, the surface geomagnetic field provides information about the variations of the fluid motion at the top of the core. The dynamic of the fluid core is also associated with mass distribution changes inside the core and produces gravitational field time fluctuations. By applying several statistical blind source separation methods to both the gravity and magnetic field time series, we investigate the common space-time variabilities. We report several robust interannual oscillations shared by the two observation sets. Among those, a common mode of around 7 years looks very significant. Whereas the nature of the driving mechanism of the coupled variability remains unclear, the spatial and temporal properties of the common signal are compatible with a core origin. </P>","Saraswati, Anita Thea;de Viron, Olivier;Mandea, Mioara;",2,1,pp.1267-1287,https://doi.org/10.5194/se-14-1267-2023,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART127871989,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART127871989&type=mobile,,,gravity core

The six cases of possible gravity-injection paths from the refueling water tank (RWT) were identified and the thermal-hydraulic analyses were performed using the RELAP5/MOD3.2 code. The core cooling capability was significantly dependent on the gravity-injection path, the RCS opening, and the injection rate. In the cases with the pressurizer manway opening higher than the RWT water level, the coolant was held up in the pressurizer and the system pressure continued increasing after gravity-injection. The gravity injection eventually stopped due to the high system pressure and the core was uncovered. In the cases with the injection path and opening on the same leg side, the core cooling was dependent on whether the water injected from the RWT passed the core region or not. However, in the cases with the injection path and opening on the different leg side, the system was well depressurized after gravity-injection and the core boiling was successfully prevented for a long-term transient. In addition, from the sensitivity study on the gravity-injection flow rate, it was found that about 54 kg/s of injection rate was required to maintain the core cooling and the core cooling could be provided for about 10.6 hours after event with that injection rate from the RWT. Those analysis results would provide useful information to operators coping with the event.","Seul, Kwang-Woo;Bang, Young-Seok;Kim, Hho-Jung;",2,1,pp.476-485,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIFullTextView?cn=JAKO199911921633081&dbt=JAKO&keyValue=05787966,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO199911921633081,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO199911921633081&type=mobile,loss-of-shutdown-cooling event . gravity-injection core cooling .

Torsional oscillations are azimuthal oscillations of rigid coaxial cylindrical surfaces and have typical periods of decades. This type of fluid motion supports geostrophic pressure gradients, which produce deformations of the core&ndash;mantle boundary. Because of the density discontinuity between the core and the mantle, such deformations produce changes in the gravity field that, because of the flow geometry, are both axisymmetric and symmetric about the equator. Torsional oscillations are thus expected to produce time variations in the zonal harmonics of even degree in the gravity field. Similarly, the changes in the rotation rates of the mantle and inner core that occur to balance the change in angular momentum carried by the torsional oscillations also produce zonal variations in gravity. We have built a model to calculate the changes in the gravity field and in the rotation rates of the mantle and inner core produced by torsional oscillations. We show that the changes in the rotation rate of the inner core produce changes in <I>J</I><SUB>2</SUB> that are a few orders of magnitude too small to be observed. The amplitudes of the changes in <I>J</I><SUB>2</SUB> from torsional oscillations are 10 times smaller than the temporal changes that are observed to occur about a linear secular trend. However, provided the mechanism responsible for these changes in <I>J</I><SUB>2</SUB> is identified and that this contribution is removed from the data, it may be possible in the future to detect the lowest harmonic degrees of the torsional oscillations in the gravity field data. We also show that torsional oscillations have contributed to the linear secular change in <I>J</I><SUB>2</SUB> by about &minus;0.75 &times; 10<SUP>&minus;12</SUP> per year in the last 20 years. Finally, the associated change in the vertical ground motion at the surface of the Earth that is predicted by our mechanism is of the order of 0.2 mm, which is too small to be detected with the current precision in measurements.</P>","Dumberry, Mathieu;Bloxham, Jeremy;",2,1,pp.417-434,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2004.02402.x,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART23108854,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART23108854&type=mobile,core&#x2013;mantle boundary .

These fascinating soils consist largely of the skeletal remains of single-celled marine organisms (plankton and zooplankton) and can be as geologically complex as their onshore siliceous counter parts. To enable an adequate understanding of their characteristics, in particular, their intra-granular micro-structure, it is important that geotechnical engineers do not forget about the multifaceted biological origins of these calcareous sediments and the different geological processes that created them. In this paper, the 3D models of soils grains generated from micro-computed tomography scans, scanning electeron microscope images, and optical microscope images of two calcareous sediments from two different depositional environments are presented and their geotechnical implications discussed. One is a coastal bioclastic sediment from Perth, Western Australia that is geologically similar to carbonate sediments typically used in micro-mechanics and particle crushing studies in the literature. The other is a hemipelagic sediment from a region of the North West Shelf of Australia that has historically been geotechnically problematic for engineers. The results show there is a marked difference between coastal bioclastic and hemipelagic sediments in terms of geological context and the associated particle micro-structures.

To investigate the controls on the Ba isotope compositions of marine sediments and their potential for paleo-oceanographic applications, we present the first Ba isotope compositions results for sediments, as well as overlying seawater depth profiles collected in the South Atlantic.

Although the fate of TBT in marine sediments has been extensively studied, very little work has been performed to assess the accumulation of organic booster biocides in sediments. A survey was conducted to determine concentrations of TBT, Irgarol 1051, the Irgarol 1051 metabolite GS26575 (2-(tert-butylamino)-4-amino-6-(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine; also referred to as M1) and diuron in coastal and off-shore sediments. TBT was consistently determined at the highest concentrations and was detected in all sediments collected from Southampton Water, UK, along with the TBT degradation product dibutyltin (DBT). Irgarol 1051 was detected (0.01&#x2013;0.11 &#x03BC;g/g) in some sediments collected from marinas, where high concentrations of these compounds have been measured in surface waters.

Further, the benthic O2 exchange rate represents the most widely used proxy for quantifying mineralization and primary production of marine sediments. Consequently, numerous researchers have investigated the benthic O2 dynamics in a wide range of environments. On the basis of case studies - from abyssal sediments to microbial phototrophic communities - I hereby try to review the current status on what we know about controls that interrelate with the O2 dynamics of marine sediments. This includes factors like: sedimentation rates, bottom water O2 concentrations, diffusive boundary layers, fauna activity, light, temperature, and sediment permeability. The investigation of benthic O2 dynamics represents a challenge in resolving variations on temporal and spatial scales covering several orders of magnitude. Such an effort requires the use of several complementary measuring techniques and modeling approaches. Recent technical developments (improved chamber approaches, O2 optodes, eddy-correlation, benthic observatories) and advances in diagenetic modeling have facilitated our abilities to resolve and interpret benthic O2 dynamics. However, all approaches have limitations and caveats that must be carefully evaluated during data interpretation. Much has been learned during the last decades but there are still many unanswered questions that need to be addressed in order to fully understand benthic O2 dynamics and the role of sediments for marine carbon cycling.</P>","Glud, Ronnie N.",2,1,pp.243-289,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17451000801888726,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART47714003,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART47714003&type=mobile,Benthic mineralization . benthic photosynthesis . biogeochemistry . in situ . lander technology . microsensors . planar optodes,,marine sediments

Following the standard approach of continuum mechanics, we derive a mathematical model for these processes by applying constitutive assumptions and a subsequent dimensional analysis to the mass and linear momentum balance equations of the solid and liquid component. The resulting mathematical model can be viewed as a system of Navier-Stokes type coupled to a degenerating convection-diffusion equation by singular perturbation terms. In two or three space dimensions, solvability of these equations depends on the choice of phase and mixture viscosities. In one space dimension, however, tills model reduces to a quasilinear strongly degenerate parabolic equation, Sor which analytical and numerical solutions are available.

Four controlling factors are identified: nature and disposition of sediments at the grounding line, transition from grounded to floating ice (ice shelves, outlet glaciers, and ice cliffs), processes of under-side melting and freezing of these ice masses, and, finally, mechanisms of iceberg calving, fragmentation, and melt-release of debris in the open ocean. Modelling studies of Brunt and Ross ice shelves suggest two main conclusions. (1) Ice shelves are of major importance for sedimentation on the continental shelf. Bulk &#x2022;debris release occurs within the grounding-line zone which may frequently oscillate, producing pronounced diachronism. Bottom melting removes all debris prior to calving at the ice front so that ice shelves do not play a part in deposition in the open ocean.

An understanding of erosion processes is required to predict and develop management practices to reduce irrigation induced erosion. Little erosion process research has been carried out under irrigation, but much of the extensive channel sediment transport and rainfall-induced erosion process research can be adapted to irrigated conditions. Soil erosion occurs when fluid in motion detaches and transports soil particles. Sedimentation occurs when the fluid transport capacity decreases to less than the sediment load. Hydraulic forces of moving water and soil factors such as aggregate stability and particle size determine erosion and sedimentation. Under furrow irrigation, the shear of the overland flow against the soil provides the detachment force and is a primary factor determining channel transport capacity. With sprinkler irrigation, water drop energy detaches particles, some of which may be transported downslope by shallow interrill flow if the water application rate exceeds the soil infiltration rate.(Author abstract)","Trout, Thomas J.;Neibling, W.

These rivers originate within the Himalayan Mountains and drain an enormous land area before entering East Pakistan. Individually, each of the rivers discharges in excess of 2.5 million cusecs of water during flood, and combined they carry nearly 6 million cusecs of water to the Bay of Bengal, nearly three times the amount borne by the Mississippi River. Having such a large drainage area, the rivers are also heavily charged with sediment, transporting approximately 13 million tons of suspended sediment per day during flood. The large discharge and heavy sediment load cause the rivers to be extremely unstable, and the channels are constantly migrating laterally. Within Recent times both rivers have occupied and abandoned numerous river courses. The Brahmaputra followed a route some 60 miles to the east of its present course only 200 years ago. The long-term patterns of river migration indicate that the Ganges has been migrating eastward, whereas the preferred migration of the Brahmaputra is westward. These movements are obviously controlled by major faults or fractures in the earth's crust.The Brahmaputra River displays a braided pattern in plan view, and short-term channel migration is quite drastic, with rates of movement as high as 2,600 ft. a year being common. The rate of rise and fall of the river, the number and position of major channels active during flood, the formation and movement of large bedforms, cohesion and variability in composition of bank material, and intensity of bank slumping are some of the factors responsible for controlling the bankline configuration and movement. The most significant bankline modifications take place during falling-river stage, when excess sediment is deposited as bars within the channel, causing a change in local flow direction and migration of the thalweg.Studies of bedform patterns and migration indicate that during a single flood cycle the bed configuration undergoes a definite sequence of changes. During low-river stage small bedforms (WH = 1-5 ft.) are present and migrate downstream at an average rate of 400ft./24 h. As discharge increases, the bedforms grow in size (WH = 5-20 ft.), and surface turbulence assumes a regular pattern on the water surface. During maximum-flood period some of the bedforms attain gigantic size, with heights up to 50 ft., and migrate downstream at rates as high as 2,000 ft./24 h. At other positions in the channel a plane bed exists, and surface turbulence patterns become oriented parallel to the channel axis. Although quite different in scale, this sequence is similar to that reported in flume studies. During low-river stage trenches on the various exposed bars revealed the type of bedding formed by migration of the various bedforms. Crossbedding measurements at these stations were recorded and compared to sand body trends.The combined Bengal Basin rivers deliver some 1 billion tons of suspended sediment a year to the Bay of Bengal, yet map and photo comparisons indicate that the shoreline has remained quite stable. Most of the sediment brought to the bay bypasses the bar and continues on into deeper water through a canyon called the Swatch of No Ground. Thus in deep water a subaqueous delta is being formed that dwarfs the subaerial delta, one of the largest in the world.","Coleman, J.M.",2,1,pp.129-239,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0037-0738(69)90010-4,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17390036,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17390036&type=mobile,,,sedimentation processes

The study was carried out on two embanked floodplains along the Rivers Rhine and Meuse in The Netherlands during a 3 day flood in January 1993. Raster maps of sediment accumulation were made by interpolating the measurements from the traps using block kriging. The sediment maps show clear patterns in sediment accumulation, together with the estimated interpolation errors. Average sediment accumulation ranges between 0&middot;57 and 1&middot;0 kg m<SUP>&#x2212;2</SUP>. High sediment accumulation is found on the levees (4 kg m<SUP>&#x2212;2</SUP> or more) and on low lying areas (1&middot;6 kg m<SUP>&#x2212;2</SUP>); sediment accumulation decreases with distance from the main channel. The sedimentation patterns are related to floodplain topography and sediment transporting mechanisms. Sediment transport by turbulent diffusion as well as by convection can be recognized. Also, flood duration and the process of sediment settling out in ponding water in closed depressions are important. The applied method allows comparison of the results with raster&#x2010;based sedimentation models.</P></P>","Asselman, Nathalie E.
