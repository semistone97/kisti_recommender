The author reflect on a project within a postgraduate architectural theory module to address the following questions: How can architectural pedagogy articulate critical modes of production that contribute to quality education in the time of the Anthropocene? What are the ideas, values and practices needed?</P></P><P>Design/methodology/approach<P>The method employed is close reading of texts focussed on three areas: critical theory and pedagogy, political theory and the Anthropocene, and architectural theory and typological urbanism. These theoretical narratives are placed in dialogue with a reflection on a design research pedagogical project. The theoretical narratives and design research project seek to articulate the multidimensionality of critical education. The methodology enacted in the paper performs the pedagogy of the classroom.</P></P><P>Findings<P>The study yields compelling conclusions regarding the potential for rethinking the idea of typology under the pressure of the Anthropocene and of critical pedagogy combined with design research to take positions on urgent political and social matters. The author concludes with a toolkit of concepts, values and knowledge practices.</P></P><P>Originality/value<P>At a time when disciplines tend towards discrete specialisation, while the need for knowledge production is ever more transdisciplinary, this paper develops inventive techniques and conceptual frameworks for supporting approaches where different fields and ideas make contact as a collective task in the era of the Anthropocene. It updates theories of typology to address contemporary pressures.</P></P>","McEwan, Cameron",2,1,pp.478-495,https://doi.org/10.1108/arch-10-2022-0232,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART126905066,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART126905066&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Analysis of the site's defensive architecture provides unique information about the city's internal design. Dry moats, walled roads, and steep terrace facades subdivide the community into a series of population segments that on the basis of both size and architecture type resemble ward divisions found in central Mexico cities at the time of Conquest. Furthermore, Xochicalco does not have a single defensive perimeter characteristic of a strongly centralized polity; instead, it possesses a series of defensive precincts located on the hills and ridges adjacent to Cerro Xochicalco that are equivalent in form and redundant in function. The model that best approximates the segmentary nature of this structure is that of a regional confederacy dominated by Xochicalco during the Epiclassic.</P></P></▼1><▼2><P><B>RESUMEN</B><P>Este estudio presenta un resumen del dise&ntilde;o y la organizati&oacute;n arquitect&oacute;nica en la ciudad de Xochicalco, Morelos, en el altiplano central de M&eacute;xico durante el epicl&aacute;sico (700-900 d.C).

We examine decommunization through the lens of an extensive legacy of architectural, urban design, and monumental art projects erected for the celebration of the 1500th anniversary of the city of Kyiv held in 1982. We focus on four ideological narratives and examine the outcomes of decommunization on four monuments. We find that decommunization&rsquo;s effect is limited; Communist symbolism has been annotated with Ukrainian identity symbols or neglected, not demolished. We conclude that decommunization has focused on the comparatively superficial qualities of toponomy and Lenin symbols, that the legacy of Soviet identity in Kyiv&rsquo;s cityscape is much deeper and has proved surprisingly persistent, and that the historiography of the newly independent nation of Ukraine is still in a process of reformation and revision. </P>","Vlasenko, Yegor;Ryan, Brent D.;",2,1,pp.247-288,https://doi.org/10.1177/00961442221079802,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART128957588,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART128957588&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

The article examines the processes of urban reconstruction and architectural reconfigurations in the city as “frontier urbanism”, building on Wendy Pullan’s (2011) discussion of how various actors employ architectural and place-making practices to secure the state in contested urban space. The article traces Rijeka/Fiume´s urban development as a window of fixating state identities in the built environment throughout the century, focusing on the aftermath of the Second World War. It examines the urban transformations of the city as the demographic landscape was reshaped after the departure of the local Italian-speaking majority and the arrival of workers from various parts of Yugoslavia, but also from Italy. By analysing decisions to rebuild or not buildings damaged by war, as well as the demolition of the 1943-built votive temple in Mlaka, the article inquires how reconstruction and urban planning became avenues to secure the state at its new frontiers.</jats:p>",Bădescu Gruia,0,1,pp.43-70,https://doi.org/10.51918/ceh.2021.1.3,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0048448119,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0048448119&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Higher urbanization rates in cities may result in high temperature warming, which is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Recently, researchers have revealed pronounced effects based on HW and UHI interactions; however, studies that linked their effects with surface energy fluxes in different urban landscape and climate are still inadequate. This study utilized the Community Land Model (CLM) to assess the effect of HW towards UHI, while considering energy fluxes variations in Seoul, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and Melbourne, with different climate influences and urban morphologies. Generally, Seoul and Tokyo showed intense HW magnitude from 2000 to 2018 based on the HW indices. The surface energy flux components demonstrated a distinct pattern especially from 11:00 to 17:00, with the exception of sensible heat in Melbourne. Further energy-flux partitioning revealed that changes in the heat storage ratio were most significant in Seoul, with 1.39 partitioning due to its larger impervious area. A smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio of open mid-rise building has enhanced urban warming in Melbourne, whereas smaller impervious and larger pervious road fraction could mitigate urban warming effects in Kuala Lumpur. Seoul showed the highest changes in daytime UHI under HW at 2.01 &deg;C, due to the low convection efficiency in compact high-rise building, while nighttime UHI was highly influenced by heat storage and anthropogenic heat release.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Seoul and Tokyo have more intense heat waves (HWs) during 2000&ndash;2018. </LI> <LI>  Latent heat, heat storage, and net radiation changed consistently from 11:00 to 17:00 during HW events. </LI> <LI>  City that has compact building type contributed to the highest heat storage ratio. </LI> <LI>  Smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio enhanced urban warming under HWs. </LI> <LI>  Urban heat island was enhanced under HW occurrences. </LI> </UL> </P>","Mohammad Harmay, Nurul Syahira;Choi, Minha;",2,1,pp.108677,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108677,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117041401,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117041401&type=mobile,Heat waves .

Using a telematic large screen event staged across Melbourne and Seoul, the paper evaluates the responses of audiences to examine the politics of cultural and civic engagement. While scholarships on creative clusters predominantly focus on the new value chain of industrial and commercial production that arises as a result of agglomeration, this paper argues that the large screen possesses the capacity not only to invigorate public participation, but as a transnational creative cluster, the networked large screen also possesses the potential to enhance the quality of intercultural communication between Asia and Australia.","Yue, A.;McQuire, S.;Papastergiadis, N.;",2,1,pp.157-164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccs.2014.06.001,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70277933,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70277933&type=mobile,Large screen .

Concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere varied widely between the cities over the course of the study, ranging from a low of 24.1&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Melbourne during the winter to a high of 376.2&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Jakarta during the dry season. Seasonal variations in both TSP and PAH were observed in the tropical cities in the study with higher concentrations during the dry season and lower concentrations during the wet season. TSP and PAH concentrations are correlated with each other in these cities, suggesting that they have related sources and sinks for these cities. In the temperate cities of Melbourne and Seoul, PAH concentrations were higher during the cold winter season and lower during the warm summer. However, TSP was quite variable over the years in these latter cities and no clear seasonal trend was observed. A number of factors have been investigated which could be contributing to seasonal variations in pollutant levels. In the temperate climates, increased emissions due to the use of fossil fuels for heating in the winter is evident. However, an interrogation of the database with respect to the other factors such as (1)increased photolytic degradation during the summer, (2)transport of pollutants from other sources, (3)removal of PAH via wet deposition and in-cloud scavenging mechanisms and (4)volatilisation of lower molecular weight species during periods of high temperature indicates the importance of multiple processes. Even though there are clearly much lower levels of both particulates and PAH in the wet season of the tropical climates, no statistically significant correlations have been observed between rainfall levels and pollutant concentrations.</P>","Panther, B.C.;Hooper, M.A.;Tapper, N.J.;",2,1,pp.4087-4099,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(99)00150-8,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART21829519,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART21829519&type=mobile,TSP .

Patients received narmafotinib as monotherapy on days -8 to -2 and then again as 4-day pulses beginning on days 3, 10 and 24 of each 28-day chemotherapy cycle.

By carefully examining the accounts of ten former North Korean residents, the researchers find that the traditional socialist economy, once prevalent in workplaces, schools, and hospitals, has now been supplanted by individual-to-individual private market interactions.

McLaren (1882-1957) was an Australian Christian missionary and a professor of psychiatry in Korea. As the first psychiatrist from a Western country, he accomplished tremendous achievements in clinical, teaching and writing activities as well as in his missionary work. He graduated from the University of Melbourne in 1906 and, after residency training under Professor Dr. Sir Richard Stawell at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, he and his wife came to Korea in 1911. He practised medicine at Margaret Whitecross Paton Memorial Hospital in Chinju, Korea and later was appointed as a professor of psychiatry at the Severance Union Medical School in Seoul, Korea. He left Korea for a while to participate in WWII as a military doctor and he also once traveled to Vienna to learn new skills, including fever therapy and psychoanalysis. Because of his love for the Korean people, Dr. McLaren not only introduced into Korean society modern Western psychiatry and a humanitarian approach to patients with mental disorders, but he also practised medicine according to his own unique medical philosophy drawn from Christian spirituality and he educated Korean native students in psychiatry and Christianity. He and his wife also made efforts to improve old customs in Korean society. Because he argued against Japan’s enforcement of emperor-worship, he had to resign from the Severance Medical College in 1939, and he returned to Chinju. Immediately after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, he was arrested, imprisoned, interned, and subequently expelled to Australia in 1942. In Melbourne, received wide press coverage and great controversy. He lectured widely and contributed to various professional and other publications, covering not only subjects in Christianity and medicine/psychiatry, but also his opinions about the war and Japan, communism and the White Australia policy. As a Christian me-dical doctor and scientist, he was interested in the “nature of man”, the relationship or interaction between body (brain and/or material) and mind/spirituality, the origin of human consciousness in relation to time-space energy, the healing of disease, and the etiology of mental illness and spiritual treatment. He was passionate in his stated belief that God’s Word applied to the whole spec-trum of human relationships, from personal to international, as well as to the natural world. Dr. McLaren kept his conservative Christian beliefs, but he respected traditional Asian philosophies. His thoughts and experiences were publically expressed through lectures, journals and books, not only in Korea but also in China and Australia. He was a man of compassion, courage and ceaseless intellectual activity, a pioneer of psychiatry and a lifelong explorer of the Bible. Korean psych-iatrists, who may feel confused by the many complicated new medical theories and advanced technologies, still find Dr. McLaren’s simple and clear teachings on science, medicine, and human nature and his practice of caring for mental patients with a compassionate, humanitarian and Christian attitude a challenging example to emulate.",민성길,0,0,pp.172-186,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001633242,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001633242,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001633242&type=mobile,,,Melbourne Seoul

This study aimed to derive a comprehensive, whole&#8208;brain characterization of large&#8208;scale axonal connectivity differences in attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) associated with catechol&#8208;O&#8208;methyltransferase gene (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism. Using diffusion tensor imaging, whole&#8208;brain tractography, and an imaging connectomics approach, we characterized altered white matter connectivity in youth with ADHD who were COMT Val&#8208;homozygous (<I>N</I>&thinsp;=&thinsp;29) compared with those who were Met&#8208;carriers (<I>N</I>&thinsp;=&thinsp;29). Additionally, we examined whether dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) and dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) polymorphisms were associated with white matter differences. Level of attention was assessed using the continuous performance test before and after an 8&#8208;week open&#8208;label trial of methylphenidate (MPH). A network of white matter connections linking 18 different brain regions was significantly weakened in youth with ADHD who were COMT Met&#8208;carriers compared to those who were Val&#8208;homozygous (<I>P</I>&thinsp;<&thinsp;0.05, family&#8208;wise error&#8208;corrected). A measure of white matter integrity, fractional anisotropy, was correlated with impaired pretreatment performance in continuous performance test omission errors and response time variability, as well as with improvement in continuous performance test response time variability after MPH treatment. Altered white matter connectivity was exclusively based on COMT genotypes, and was not evident in DAT1 or DRD4. We demonstrated that white matter connectivity in youth with ADHD is associated with COMT Val158Met genotypes. The present findings suggest that different layers of dopamine&#8208;related genes and interindividual variability in the genetic polymorphisms should be taken into account when investigating the human connectome. <I>Hum Brain Mapp, 36:367&ndash;377, 2015</I>. &copy; <B>2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</B></P>","Hong, Soon&#x2010;Beom;Zalesky, Andrew;Park, Subin;Yang, Young&#x2010;Hui;Park, Min&#x2010;Hyeon;Kim, BoAh;Song, In&#x2010;Chan;Sohn, Chul&#x2010;Ho;Shin, Min&#x2010;Sup;Kim, Bung&#x2010;Nyun;Cho, Soo&#x2010;Churl;Kim, Jae&#x2010;Won;",2,1,pp.367-377,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.22634,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70983995,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70983995&type=mobile,attention&#x2010;deficit/hyperactivity disorder . catechol&#x2010;O&#x2010;methyltransferase . diffusion tensor imaging . methylphenidate . white matter;,,Melbourne Seoul

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Solving complex problems such as preventing chronic diseases introduces
unique challenges for the creation and application of knowledge, or knowledge to action
(KTA). KTA approaches that apply principles of systems thinking are thought to hold
promise, but practical strategies for their application are not well understood. In this
paper we report the results of a scan of systems approaches to KTA with a goal to
identify how to optimize their implementation and impact.</p>
       </sec>
       <sec>
         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>A 5-person advisory group purposefully selected 9 initiatives to achieve
diversity on issues addressed and organizational forms. Information on each case was
gathered from documents and through telephone interviews with primary contacts
within each organization. Following verification of case descriptions, an inductive
analysis was conducted within and across cases.</p>
       </sec>
       <sec>
         <title>Results</title>
         <p>The cases revealed 5 guidelines for moving from conceiving KTA systems to
implementing them: 1) establish and nurture relationships, 2) co-produce and curate
knowledge, 3) create feedback loops, 4) frame as systems interventions rather than
projects, and 5) consider variations across time and place.</p>
       </sec>
	   <sec>
         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Results from the environmental scan are a modest start to translating
systems concepts for KTA into practice. Use of the strategies revealed in the scan may
improve KTA for solving complex public health problems. The strategies themselves will
benefit from the development of a science that aims to understand adaptation and
ongoing learning from policy and practice interventions, strengthens enduring
relationships, and fills system gaps in addition to evidence gaps. Systems approaches
to KTA will also benefit from robust evaluations.</p>

The Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework was developed in Canada by Graham and colleagues in the 2000s, following a review of 31 planned action theories. The framework has two components: Knowledge Creation and an Action Cycle, each of which comprises multiple phases. This review sought to answer two questions: ‘Is the KTA Framework used in practice? And if so, how?’</P><P><B>Methods</B></P><P>This study is a citation analysis and systematic review. The index citation for the original paper was identified on three databases&#x2014;Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar&#x2014;with the facility for citation searching. Limitations of English language and year of publication 2006-June 2013 were set. A taxonomy categorising the continuum of usage was developed. Only studies applying the framework to implementation projects were included. Data were extracted and mapped against each phase of the framework for studies where it was integral to the implementation project.</P><P><B>Results</B></P><P>The citation search yielded 1,787 records. A total of 1,057 titles and abstracts were screened. One hundred and forty-six studies described usage to varying degrees, ranging from referenced to integrated. In ten studies, the KTA Framework was integral to the design, delivery and evaluation of the implementation activities. All ten described using the Action Cycle and seven referred to Knowledge Creation. The KTA Framework was enacted in different health care and academic settings with projects targeted at patients, the public, and nursing and allied health professionals.</P><P><B>Conclusions</B></P><P>The KTA Framework is being used in practice with varying degrees of completeness. It is frequently cited, with usage ranging from simple attribution via a reference, through informing planning, to making an intellectual contribution. When the framework was integral to knowledge translation, it guided action in idiosyncratic ways and there was theory fidelity. Prevailing wisdom encourages the use of theories, models and conceptual frameworks, yet their application is less evident in practice. This may be an artefact of reporting, indicating that prospective, primary research is needed to explore the real value of the KTA Framework and similar tools.</P><P><B>Electronic supplementary material</B></P><P>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13012-014-0172-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</P>","Field, Becky;Booth, Andrew;Ilott, Irene;Gerrish, Kate;",2,1,pp.172,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13012-014-0172-2,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART71823984,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART71823984&type=mobile,Knowledge translation .

The development of the proposed design strategy is based on a methodology with elements from &ldquo;Knowledge to Action (KTA),&rdquo; &ldquo;Action research&rdquo; and a &ldquo;List of value concepts.&rdquo; The rigid timetable guaranteed systematic progress, where both knowledge from the end-users and experts were incorporated throughout the decision-making process.</P></P><P>Findings<P>The two case studies documented results involving end-users and experts in a systematic way.

Architects should make the design process transparent so that one can see which design decisions have been made through the design process. This must be done to ensure that there is greater coherence between vision and practice.</P></P><P>Originality/value<P>The study showed how architects could import knowledge, skills and values from other disciplines such as environmental psychology and active living research to improve the decision-making process of future sport and recreation projects.

The aim of this study was to examine housing and support needs and preferences of people with MS with the intention to inform the planning of a co-designed intervention based on the study&rsquo;s findings. Methods Using the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework, quantitative (n = 79) and qualitative (n = 6) data from people with MS were extracted and integrated from projects completed by the research team that explored the housing and support needs and preferences of people with disability. Results were synthesised and presented to a reference group for validation, contextualisation, and adaptation to the Australian context. Results High physical support needs were common across participants. People most commonly required home modifications to improve accessibility, such as ramps, equipment such as heating and cooling, and assistive technology. Many people required more than 8 hours per day of paid support. Moving into individualised housing facilitated independence and community reintegration. People reported gaps between what they wanted from support workers and what they received, citing individual and systemic barriers. Conclusion People with MS have support needs that require proactive and responsive funding arrangements, housing design and support provision. In line with KTA principles, findings will inform the planning of a co-designed intervention that involves people with lived experience of MS and other stakeholders to influence policy and improve home and living outcomes for this population.</P>","Cubis, Lee;McDonald, Sharyn;Dean, Pamela;Ramme, Robin;D’Cruz, Kate;Topping, Megan;Fisher, Fiona;Winkler, Di;Douglas, Jacinta;",2,1,,https://doi.org/10.1071/ib23102,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART131268411,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART131268411&type=mobile,,,KTA projects

While researchers have conducted systematic reviews on a range of software-based information and communication technologies as well as other social media (eg, virtual communities of practice, virtual peer-to-peer communities, and electronic support groups), none have reviewed collaborative writing applications in the medical sector. The overarching goal of this project is to explore the depth and breadth of evidence for the use of collaborative writing applications in health care. Thus, the purposes of this scoping review will be to (1) map the literature on collaborative writing applications; (2) compare the applications’ features; (3) describe the evidence of each application’s positive and negative effects as a KT intervention in health care; (4) inventory and describe the barriers and facilitators that affect the applications’ use; and (5) produce an action plan and a research agenda. A six-stage framework for scoping reviews will be used: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies within the selected databases (using the EPPI-Reviewer software to classify the studies); (3) selecting studies (an iterative process in which two reviewers search the literature, refine the search strategy, and review articles for inclusion); (4) charting the data (using EPPI-Reviewer’s data-charting form); (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results (performing a descriptive, numerical, and interpretive synthesis); and (6) consulting knowledge users during three planned meetings. Since this scoping review concerns the use of collaborative writing applications as KT interventions in health care, we will use the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework to describe and compare the various studies and collaborative writing projects we find. In addition to guiding the use of collaborative writing applications in health care, this scoping review will advance the science of KT by testing tools that could be used to evaluate other social media. We also expect to identify areas that require further systematic reviews and primary research and to produce a highly relevant research agenda that explores and leverages the potential of collaborative writing software. To date, this is the first study to use the KTA framework to study the role collaborative writing applications in KT, and the first to involve three national and international institutional knowledge users as part of the research process.</P>","Archambault, Patrick Michel;van de Belt, Tom H;Grajales III, Francisco J;Eysenbach, Gunther;Aubin, Karine;Gold, Irving;Gagnon, Marie-Pierre;Kuziemsky, Craig E;Turgeon, Alexis F;Poitras, Julien;Faber, Marjan J;Kremer, Jan A.M;Heldoorn, Marcel;Bilodeau, Andrea;L&eacute;gar&eacute;, France;",2,1,pp.e1,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/resprot.1993,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART69831999,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART69831999&type=mobile,,,KTA projects

ART003066051,JAKO,,한국공간디자인학회,한국공간디자인학회 논문집,;;,,,19,2,2024,,ART003066051,Analyzing Public Access and Boundary Utilization in Landscape Architecture,"(Background and Purpose) In contemporary society, Landscape Architecture crucially addresses the relationships between architecture and landscape, as well as individual and public realms within cities, establishing boundaries as areas with potential for communication while maintaining continuity between buildings and land. Despite the existence of developments ranging from single buildings to large-scale urban projects, many boundary and green spaces are currently applied in cities in isolated and passive ways, with limited functionality in terms of accessibility and publicness. Furthermore, the potential of Landscape Architecture to function diversely within urban environments is underutilized due to a lack of research on its boundary components and methods, compounded by uniform regulations. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes using the boundary spaces of buildings as a solution to practical urban problems, examining the construction methods and components of Landscape Architecture's boundary spaces to advance the concept of 'publicness' in both current and future architectural developments. (Method) This research employs case studies to examine the integration methods of Landscape Architecture within urban conditions, leveraging landscape concepts to bridge diverse aspects and elements. The study emphasizes the critical elements of Landscape Architecture, such as the rates of 'open area' and 'openness,' by investigating international architectural projects. These case studies are instrumental in understanding the types, access, efficiency, and rates of open areas, which are pivotal in expressing the public usage of Landscape Architectures numerically. (Results) The boundary spaces of Landscape Architecture, reflecting the urban context and locality, have shown high potential for public use and were categorized for analysis accordingly. This study introduced an innovative 'publicness graph,' linking objective indicators like 'public area ratio' and 'openness' to visualize detailed characteristics. By defining the Public Occupancy Index (POI) and Balance Deviation Index (BDI), the study quantitatively categorized the 'publicness' of individual buildings, which had previously been expressed qualitatively. (Conclusions) The study concludes that Landscape Architecture holds the potential to revolutionize the design and functionality of public spaces within urban landscapes. Through case analysis and conceptual establishment of the use of boundary spaces in landscape architecture, a quantitative analysis method has been presented. By applying the types of 'Street type', 'Park type', and 'Street + Park type' as case studies, the validity of the analytical method that quantifies the individual characteristics of buildings associated with publicness proposed in this paper has been confirmed. The analysis method based on the 'Publicness Graph' is expected to contribute significantly to the development of design plans and models that can optimize the public use of increasingly complex boundary spaces in modern architecture.",장재우;이상윤;,0,0,pp.107-120,http://dx.doi.org/10.35216/kisd.2024.19.2.107,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003066051,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003066051,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003066051&type=mobile,,,public architecture

Since sustainability is linked to public values, research on sustainable public spaces is an important way to secure sustainability in cities. Based on this, we analyzed the sustainability of European cities by examining the design methods of public architecture according to the region. The aim of the study is to derive architectural methodology corresponding to local characteristics, and to suggest issues to consider in public architecture design to promote urban sustainability based on this. First, regarding the environmental aspect, it can be observed that there is an effort to secure sustainability. Second, in terms of social sustainability, historical value remains as a trace of architectural place, so that it continues in people&rsquo;s memory. In addition, public architecture provides public places where citizens can gather and enjoy programs, while the architectural methods showed differences influenced by cultural conditions. Third, in economic sustainability, it was shown that energy saving was achieved through cost reduction through recycling of materials, facilities, or environmental factors. In conclusion, the issues to be considered in public architectural design are the voiding of urban space through architectural devices in the construction method. In other words, the intention is to form &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that attempts to be part of the city, and thereby create better places. Since skin and material have a deep relationship with the environment, they should have the durability and an outer skin that are suitable for the regional environment. Finally, sustainability is to be utilized through the influx of programs that meet local and environmental characteristics. Design research into public architecture that is oriented towards urban sustainability will be a task to be carried out by the present generation for the millennial generation.</P>","Kim, Soomi;Kwon, Hyun-ah;",2,1,pp.1249,https://doi.org/10.3390/su10041249,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART90662159,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART90662159&type=mobile,,,public architecture

The scenario is based on the partitioning of broadband network functions between synchronous fiber transmission systems and cell-based transport. The first stage of evolution incorporates frame-based switching to support increasing data traffic for LAN (local area network) interconnections. Cell-based technology appears first in the form of point-to-point high-speed data trunks and then as switched high-speed access. Centralized cell switching will provide interconnect between cell-based trunks and shared access lines. Remote cell multipliers will provide traffic concentration when the number of customers further increases. Since cell transport will first be introduced in the network as an extension of frame transport to higher speed, interworking between cells and frames will be necessary.</P>","Wernik, M.R.;Munter, E.A.;",2,1,pp.83-89,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/35.64724,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART12614717,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART12614717&type=mobile,,,public architecture
ART002574806,JAKO,,한국엔터프라이즈아키텍처학회,정보화연구,;;,,,17,1,2020,,ART002574806,Critical Success Factors for Applying Enterprise Architecture to Cloud Computing Adoption in the Public Sector,"Public sector organisations are continuously looking for ways to redesign their information systems and operations to take advantage of technology. Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Computing are two of the most common approaches under consistently under consideration by organisations. Moreover, the two domains are becoming integral components of the Digital transformation agenda. However, existing literature shows that most research focuses on studying Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Computing as separate domains despite their fast convergence. This study presents findings from considering the converged critical success factors of applying Enterprise Architecture to cloud computing adoption in the public sector. The research deployed a modified Delphi technique to identify essential elements of success from twenty-one experts based in Korea and Botswana. The study utilised Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) and cohesion analysis on factors identified by experts to propose a novel factor classification model composed of Service Design, EA Capability, Organisation and Economic factors. The findings further showed that Organisational and Economic factors exhibit a moderating effect on Cloud Computing adoption. The study contributes practical implications for researchers, policymakers and practitioners in the domains of Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Computing.",Christopher B.

In rare instances, it has been possible to create architecture specifically to foster IE, as in the &ldquo;tri-faith&rdquo; Abrahamic campus in Omaha and the Berlin House of One. The theme is: Here we are, accepting that we share the world. Another form of IE that deserves to attract more interest is multireligious collaboration in civic work (addressing homelessness, urban blight, illiteracy, etc.). Some adherents of the intrinsically cosmopolitan &ldquo;world&rdquo; religions are actively cosmopolitan to the extent of seeking this engagement. The theme is: Let us share the work of the world, including sharing our religiously inflected processing of what the practical issues facing us are. There is a new initiative of this sort in my city, Jackson, Mississippi, named (from M. L. King) the &ldquo;Beloved Community&rdquo;. An architectural thought experiment may prove helpful in articulating the ideals for such an endeavor. What would be the physical desiderata for its headquarters? Let us imagine a new downtown building, The Meeting, dedicated to housing meetings where mixed religious groups learn about civic issues and coordinate efforts to address them. Full interreligious sharing of a space seems to require a neutral design lacking any definite religious inspiration. But there are nonsectarian ways to create an appreciably special, non-ordinary space, as in courtrooms and classrooms. Could a civic IE headquarters be special, expressive of practical optimism, and contain a sufficient religious allusion to qualify as a &ldquo;next-to-sacred space&rdquo; in which religious actors felt supported in the civic extension of their religious lives? I offer suggestions for discussion, including (1) a pavilion-style building suggestive of being set up for a special purpose-not soaringly grandiose but with a vertical feature such as a central roof lantern; (2) at least one major porch, with benches and tables; (3) an outside water fountain with public water supply (a historical allusion to the Islamic sabil); (4) inside, right-sized meeting rooms around the glass-walled periphery; (5) a big &ldquo;living room&rdquo; lounge in the center, usable for larger meetings, with access to a kitchen, and with a big project board for tracking work completed and work in hand next to a large map of the city; (6) a moderate descent of several steps into each meeting room so that there is a feeling of commitment in attending a meeting and a sense of challenge in going forth from one; (7) otherwise a main floor levelness and openness facilitating movement in and out, as in a train station; and (8) upstairs small offices for religious and other qualifying organizations. Answering the aesthetic and practical questions these suggestions raise takes us into imagining civic IE more concretely.</P>","Smith, Steven G.",2,1,pp.360,https://doi.org/10.3390/rel15030360,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART129381278,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART129381278&type=mobile,,,civic architecture
