The author reflect on a project within a postgraduate architectural theory module to address the following questions: How can architectural pedagogy articulate critical modes of production that contribute to quality education in the time of the Anthropocene? What are the ideas, values and practices needed?</P></P><P>Design/methodology/approach<P>The method employed is close reading of texts focussed on three areas: critical theory and pedagogy, political theory and the Anthropocene, and architectural theory and typological urbanism. These theoretical narratives are placed in dialogue with a reflection on a design research pedagogical project. The theoretical narratives and design research project seek to articulate the multidimensionality of critical education. The methodology enacted in the paper performs the pedagogy of the classroom.</P></P><P>Findings<P>The study yields compelling conclusions regarding the potential for rethinking the idea of typology under the pressure of the Anthropocene and of critical pedagogy combined with design research to take positions on urgent political and social matters. The author concludes with a toolkit of concepts, values and knowledge practices.</P></P><P>Originality/value<P>At a time when disciplines tend towards discrete specialisation, while the need for knowledge production is ever more transdisciplinary, this paper develops inventive techniques and conceptual frameworks for supporting approaches where different fields and ideas make contact as a collective task in the era of the Anthropocene. It updates theories of typology to address contemporary pressures.</P></P>","McEwan, Cameron",2,1,pp.478-495,https://doi.org/10.1108/arch-10-2022-0232,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART126905066,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART126905066&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Analysis of the site's defensive architecture provides unique information about the city's internal design. Dry moats, walled roads, and steep terrace facades subdivide the community into a series of population segments that on the basis of both size and architecture type resemble ward divisions found in central Mexico cities at the time of Conquest. Furthermore, Xochicalco does not have a single defensive perimeter characteristic of a strongly centralized polity; instead, it possesses a series of defensive precincts located on the hills and ridges adjacent to Cerro Xochicalco that are equivalent in form and redundant in function. The model that best approximates the segmentary nature of this structure is that of a regional confederacy dominated by Xochicalco during the Epiclassic.</P></P></▼1><▼2><P><B>RESUMEN</B><P>Este estudio presenta un resumen del dise&ntilde;o y la organizati&oacute;n arquitect&oacute;nica en la ciudad de Xochicalco, Morelos, en el altiplano central de M&eacute;xico durante el epicl&aacute;sico (700-900 d.C).

We examine decommunization through the lens of an extensive legacy of architectural, urban design, and monumental art projects erected for the celebration of the 1500th anniversary of the city of Kyiv held in 1982. We focus on four ideological narratives and examine the outcomes of decommunization on four monuments. We find that decommunization&rsquo;s effect is limited; Communist symbolism has been annotated with Ukrainian identity symbols or neglected, not demolished. We conclude that decommunization has focused on the comparatively superficial qualities of toponomy and Lenin symbols, that the legacy of Soviet identity in Kyiv&rsquo;s cityscape is much deeper and has proved surprisingly persistent, and that the historiography of the newly independent nation of Ukraine is still in a process of reformation and revision. </P>","Vlasenko, Yegor;Ryan, Brent D.;",2,1,pp.247-288,https://doi.org/10.1177/00961442221079802,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART128957588,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART128957588&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

The article examines the processes of urban reconstruction and architectural reconfigurations in the city as “frontier urbanism”, building on Wendy Pullan’s (2011) discussion of how various actors employ architectural and place-making practices to secure the state in contested urban space. The article traces Rijeka/Fiume´s urban development as a window of fixating state identities in the built environment throughout the century, focusing on the aftermath of the Second World War. It examines the urban transformations of the city as the demographic landscape was reshaped after the departure of the local Italian-speaking majority and the arrival of workers from various parts of Yugoslavia, but also from Italy. By analysing decisions to rebuild or not buildings damaged by war, as well as the demolition of the 1943-built votive temple in Mlaka, the article inquires how reconstruction and urban planning became avenues to secure the state at its new frontiers.</jats:p>",Bădescu Gruia,0,1,pp.43-70,https://doi.org/10.51918/ceh.2021.1.3,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0048448119,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0048448119&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Accordingly, this research was aimed at illuminating art and technology interactions in Islamic architecture during early globalization when it flourished along with Christian architecture. To this end, logical reasoning and qualitative data analysis were performed in parallel on 12 chains of mostly worship-oriented artworks, such as mosques and churches. The results indicated that art and technology interactions in Islamic and Christian architecture were underlain by the same nature and sequential pattern of beginning from primitive technology and ending with innovative technology (art). The cultural and technological value of these architectural styles eventually crossed geographical boundaries. Therefore, the beneficial interactions between art and technology enabled Islamic and Christian architecture to participate in globalization through the conveyance of their value to other regions even as differences existed in the measures implemented for such transmission.</P>","Asefi, Maziar;Khasraghi, Safa Salkhi;Roders, Ana Pereira;",2,1,pp.66-79,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foar.2018.12.003,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART95831271,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART95831271&type=mobile,Art-technology interactions .

In this respect, this article forms part of this scholarly investigation with which the theme, ''hybrid'' has been utilised to overcome the spatial shortcomings of a specific town in the Balkans -Pogradec. Combining insights from sociological and political realities of the context, it introduces a critique of the transmission model of design education, which renders studio works as passive abstract practices removed from social and cultural realities.

The topicality of this approach is explained either by the manner of international communication about sacred architecture, or by the work of German architect Rudolf Schwarz (1897-1961), who is cited anew, very often due to his unification of architectural praxis, scientific activity and a life of a devoted man deservedly still influential in the field. A church can be understood by its operative function. Throughout the most important liturgical reform movements of the 20th century, one can get an insight into the spatial concepts of the designers, which, consciously or not, reflect the achievements of these movements even today.</P><P>In the contemporary praxis of Latin Rite liturgy, the divorce between the once close-knit aspects of the worship are palpable, thanks to these reforms on the one hand, and their late interpretations on the other. Inspired by autonomous readings, the sacrificial act of the Eucharist (sacrificium) and the symbol of the communal feast (cena) were associated with correspondent models of space. This problem shares root with the frequent contraposition of personal devotion and the communio: the former prevails in oriented spaces, while the latter appears in the central. Spatial concepts capable of respecting both religious devotion and the needs of the community in their primordial unity and theological profoundness, seldom can be found today. Following the terminology of Albert Gerhards and Walter Zahner, these are often referred to as communio-spaces (Communio-R&auml;ume). Albeit the proposition of this space type is clearly theoretical, it looks back to important antecedents from the 20th century, and defines a multiplicity of new directions. The story of communio-space spans from Rudolf Schwarz to the contemporary church architecture of Central and Western Europe as well as North America, and still influences the newest designs of liturgical spaces. In Hungary, this recent issue of spatial arrangement is not a question of a substantial debate up to now, yet even this limited number of experiments necessitate the idea and applied examples of communio-space to acquire more attention here as well.</P>","Katona, Vilmos",2,1,pp.173-213,https://doi.org/10.1556/096.2017.45.1-2.9,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART91654936,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART91654936&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

These components are envisioned to harmonize various methodologies and to depict a picture of what research in architecture and urbanism could be within an identified set of domains. This approach is grounded in a rigorous literature review, empirical evidence, and relevant validation through case studies. The application of this approach instigates a series of research scenarios which act as frameworks that provide new insights into design and practice-based research, building anatomy research, city dynamics research, housing dynamics research, and user perception studies. Each scenario demonstrates the applicability of combining theoretical insights with empirical investigations.

At the same time, the avant-garde utopian conception was formed as another critical architectural disposition corresponding to specific practices based on 19th century's utopian movements. These two phenomena embraced the generation of two predominant architectural dispositions, the 'urban architecture' and 'subterranean urban architecture', respectively, which account for the architecture and urbanism of the 60s and 70s.

These processes relate to the processes and technologies of urbanism. One of the key human problems in urbanism is the problem of comfort. The authors developed the structure of the formation of signs of human comfort by environmental factors, structure of human interaction with the physical components of the environment under urbanism. Studies show that the thermal load on a person increases in areas of urban space, where the surfaces of structures have a high density. The authors developed the system for generating thermal comfort for design of architectural objects in high temperature. Heat loss by convection requires external air movement. The article presents new scheme the surface microstructure of small local objects (for the facade decoration, objects of restrictive structures, window decorations and additional design objects of the urban environment). Additional layers of materials include heat-storing components. The development of a variety of design solutions based on the proposed concept will allow us to solve the problems of not only comfort in urbanism, but also to form new directions in the range of functional building materials and architectural objects.</P></P>","Cherunova, I V;Kuleshova, A A;Kokuashvili, N B;",2,1,pp.032086,https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/962/3/032086,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART110734464,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART110734464&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

(연구방법) 국외의 문헌조사 및 선행연구를 통해랜드스케이프 어바니즘의 공간적 특성을 도출하기 위해 이론에 대한 개념과 정의를 제고하였다. 이를 통한 9가지 개념을 도출하고, 국내 적용 시 개념에 대한 타당성을 확인하기 위해 최근 랜드스케이프 어바니즘 관점의 국내 선행연구를 비교 분석하여 5가지의 공통 특성을 도출하였다. 사례분석에 적용하기 위한 세부평가항목을 선행연구에서 정의하는 내용을 토대로 제작하였다. 건축물의 입체녹화 정의 및 종류에 대한 이론적 고찰을 진행하고, 최근 건축물 입체녹화와 관련된 선행연구 동향을 파악하였다. 사례분석의 대상으로 (사)인공지반녹화협회에서 주최하는 인공지반녹화대상의 최근 10년 이내의 준공작 중 도시 내에 위치하는대상작을 선별하였다. 도출된 랜드스케이프 어바니즘의 공간적 특성에 의한 세부평가항목으로 사례를 통해 건축물 입체녹화 공간적 특징을 도출하고자 한다. (결과) 선행연구의 분석을 통해 랜드스케이프 어바니즘의 공간적 특성 중 도출한 개념으로는 수평성, 생태, 인프라스트럭쳐, 프로세스(과정,시간), 부지(장소에 대한 창조적 정의)로 5가지 주요 특성을 도출하였다. 이에 본 연구에서는 각 특성의 세부평가항목에 따라 최근 국내 도시의 입체녹화 건축물 사례를 분석하여, 가장 공통적 사항이 많은 세 가지의 공간적 특성을 선별하였다. 첫째, 대지 내에 2개 이상의 녹지 레이어를 형성하고, 두 번째로, 인프라스트럭쳐로서 다수의 인원이 수용가능한 대공간의 형태를 갖추고, 셋째는 기존대지가 갖는 장소의 성격과는 다른 입체녹화공간을 통한 새로운 장소적 특수성을 갖는다는 것이다. (결론) 건축물 입체녹화공간은 단일 건축물 하나 내에서 뿐만 아니라 보통 다중이 이용하는 시설에 배치되어 도시적 관점에서 분석이 필요하다. 이에 도시, 건축, 조경이라는 랜드스케이프 어바니즘과의 상관관계가 존재하여 공간계획 시 반영해야할 도시이론이다. 본 연구는 조경, 도시, 건축적 맥락을 고려한 랜드스케이프 어바니즘의 공간적 특성을 최근국내 선행연구를 통해 정리하며, 앞으로의 건축물 입체녹화 공간의 방향성을 제언하고, 최근 국내의 사례분석을 통해 적용가능성에 대해 밝힌 것에 연구의 의의가 있다.",이영광;김용성;이남규;,0,1,pp.25-36,http://dx.doi.org/10.35216/kisd.2022.17.8.25,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0041557597,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0041557597&type=mobile,Landscape Urbanism .

This study finds out that some modernist slogans such as community and social reform are nothing but rhetoric to embellish the approach. However, this study puts a premium on the meaning of New Urbanism as a new paradigm of urban planning although the social slogan raised by the movement sounds unrealistic.

Hermeneutical methodology is used to analyze the behavioral attitudes of citizens, and the system methodology of urbanism allows to identify ensembles in architectural structures. The unity of the culturological and urban allows us to immerse the problem field of the city in the context of human existence.

As a result, a new architectural element of the artistic image of the city appears. The necessity of ecology of the visual environment of the city is emphasized, including the upbringing of a citizen who takes care of the construction and architectural heritage and the environment.

After briefly discussing the role of urbanism in the French &#x2018;civilizing mission,&#x2019; the essay aims to analyze two opposing currents in post-colonial urbanism. First, it relays the extent to which the French built environment of Algiers was capable of encouraging patterns of life for its new inhabitants, and the degree to which that power affects memories of colonial urbanism. Second, it examines the antonymous, parallel quest to reclaim that symbolically heavy territory with icons, symbols and representations of Algerian nationalism, particularly through street names, statues, and public art, a process that both revealed the complexities of the state&#x2019;s nationalism and provoked its contradictions. Despite the FLN&#x2019;s best efforts, the city as palimpsest persists.

It also explains how space is deployed for the construction of cognitive system between natural landscape and architectural scenery in terms of space, hoping to make a contribution to design method of contemporary house as an elementary datum. Method: Three issues are studied, focusing on the designs around nineteenth thirties in the earliest phase of Le Corbusier: How architectural form and nature is related, how natural greens is introduced into urbanism, and how natural landscape is introduced to house design. 1) it is studied how the relation between the nature and the formal elements of purism in Le Corbusier's architecture is formed. 2) it is studied how the relation between the nature and architecture proposed in Le Corbusier's urbanism is formed. 3) Le Corbusier's 'four compositions' is analyzed in terms of relation-formation between architectural space and the nature. 4) it is studied how the natural landscape is introduced to Le Corbusier's house-design in the form of architectural promenade.

At the same time, the avant-garde utopian conception was formed as another critical architectural disposition corresponding to specific practices based on 19th century’s utopian movements.

At the same time, 61% of residential buildings in the country were built before 1970, that is, they are morally and physically outdated. This fact is a significant problem that threatens the stable functioning of our cities. It is for this reason that it is extremely important to develop methods of monitoring, strategic planning and anti-crisis management in architectural urbanism. In this article, as such a tool, the methods of compiling 'Nodes of problems' are proposed, which are a component of a new paradigm - 'Anti-crisis management in architectural urbanism', which is a component of such scientific and practical directions 'Architectural urbanism' and 'Urban management'. 'Node of problems' is a grapho-analytical method of outputting data obtained with the help of the 'Software complex for modeling the city as a dynamic system', which is currently being developed at XNUUE named after O.M. Beketov.&#x0D;
The new scientific direction 'Anti-crisis management in architectural urbanism' is an actual response to the problem that has arisen in the field of complex reconstruction of quarters (microdistricts) of the outdated housing stock. Urban planning is the science of the city of extensive type of development. No urban planning regulations and rules indicate what to do with urban voids on the sites of abandoned factories, what to do with the problem of marginalization of 'working quarters', how to implement road maps for optimizing the city's housing stock in conditions of almost complete disregard by the population of legislative requirements, and most importantly - how to achieve positive changes in the problem of housing reconstruction in conditions of limited access to resources.&#x0D;
The essence of the method is to reflect the set of contradictions between the principles of functioning of the elements of the city system. The contradiction is the result of centrifugal and centripetal efforts arising in the processes of meeting the vital needs of the social component of the city. The city itself is considered as a collection of artifacts belonging to the social, man-made or natural subsystem. Dynamic processes of city functioning occur as a result of the interaction of these subsystems.</jats:p>",Fomenko Oksana;Danylov Serhii;Vіgdorovich Olga;,0,1,pp.170-198,https://doi.org/10.32347/2077-3455.2023.65.170-198,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0043034980,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0043034980&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Among the interventions needed to adapt the buildings to their new purpose, improving the energy performance is always a challenge due to their particular construction solutions and the influence that these improvements can have on their protected elements. The regulations in force in European Union (EU) member states leave a gap in how the energy performance evaluations in these types of buildings can be defined, and even exclude them from the process. However, rehabilitation of buildings is always seen as an opportunity, because it allows the building to once again be useful to society and play an important role in people&rsquo;s lives. At the same time, it can also improve their performance and allow benefits to be gained from their use through a reduction in maintenance costs. In the rehabilitation process, the economic viability of the renovation plays a fundamental role which must be compared, in the case of protected buildings, to its impact on the architecture of the building. Since 2002, the EU has issued directives with the aim that countries should define objective methods to improve the energy performance of buildings and, in recent times, methods that demonstrate the amortization of such improvements. Within the process of implementing the new methodologies adapted to the EPBD, Spain was one of the last EU countries to define a process for the energy assessment of existing buildings, introducing an analysis of the economic viability of the construction improvements suggested in the process. The objective of this research was to describe the decision-making process during the evaluation of the feasibility of introducing construction improvements to the energy performance of two catalogued historic buildings located in a warm climate. The estimated energy consumption was evaluated, the net present value (NPV) and the payback period of the investment calculated, and the results obtained were compared with the real energy consumption. At the end of the process, it can be said that the methodologies adopted in Spain offer results that can lead designers to make wrong decisions that may affect the protected heritage values of these buildings.</P>","Galiano-Garrig&oacute;s, Antonio;Gonz&aacute;lez-Avil&eacute;s, &Aacute;ngel;Rizo-Maestre, Carlos;And&uacute;jar-Montoya, MªDolores;",2,1,pp.4946,https://doi.org/10.3390/su11184946,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART109914930,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART109914930&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Landscape Urbanism, an urban theory advocated by many scholars, landscapers, urban planners, and architects for a long time, includes the components of landscaping, cities, and architecture. The three-dimensional greening of buildings includes architecture and landscaping, and has a similar context. As prior research has shown the effect of three-dimensional greening of buildings as an environmental solution to urban problems, the capacity for three-dimensional greening of buildings is expected to increase.The purpose of this study is to analyze the three-dimensional green space of buildings based on the spatial characteristics of landscape urbanism, and to present matters to be considered in future architectural planning. (Method) To derive nine concepts and confirm the validity of these concepts when applied in Korea, five common characteristics were derived by comparing and analyzing previous domestic studies from the perspective of landscape urbanism. A theoretical review was conducted on the definition and type of three-dimensional greening of buildings, and recent trends in previous studies related to it were identified. As the subject of the case analysis, target works from the city were selected among completed works within the last 10 years of “the artificial ground greening prize”, hosted by “the Artificial Ground Greening Association.” For detailed evaluation, we intend to derive spatial characteristics of the three-dimensional greening of buildings through examples. (Results) Five main spatial characteristics of landscape urbanism were derived: horizontality, ecology, infrastructure, process, and site. Therefore, this study analyzed recent cases of three-dimensional green buildings in domestic cities according to the detailed evaluation items of each characteristic, and selected three spatial characteristics with the most common items. First, it forms two or more green layers in the land; second, it has a large space that can accommodate a large number of people as infrastructure; and third, it has a new location specificity through a three-dimensional green space that is different in nature from the existing land. (Conclusions) There is a correlation with landscape urbanism, such as urban, architectural, and landscape; therefore, it is an urban theory to be reflected in space planning. This study summarizes the spatial characteristics of landscape urbanism considering the landscape, urban, and architectural context through recent domestic studies, suggests the direction of three-dimensional green space, and reveals its applicability through domestic case analysis.",이영광;김용성;이남규;,0,0,pp.25-36,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002913740,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002913740&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Towards a tectonic approach to urban design,"Urban challenges derived from climate prospects and densification call for a renewed engagement with the question of the liveability of the built environment. Within this context, the economic and technical concept of our cities is an increasingly dominant aspect, whereas the fragile but vital question of ambiance that seemingly signifies our sense of liveability is often suppressed. This requires us, as architects and urban designers, to refine our descriptions of ambiance as an integral part of the technical construction principles applied in the built environment, hereby considering it a continuous space, as suggested in theories of landscape urbanism. By recalling the etymological meaning of tectonics as a contextual joining of aesthetics and technology at the architectural scale, the paper states that this can be understood as a tectonic challenge which crosses the architectural and urban domains. As a result, the potential is opened up to develop further the theory of landscape urbanism by juxtaposing it with tectonic architectural theory. The paper investigates this potential through a combined conceptual and analytical case, studying whether it is possible to define and describe urban ambiances across scale, in relation to the concept of the built environment, when applying an “urban tectonic” perspective.",Christiansen Elias Melvin;Laursen Lea Holst;Hvejsel Marie Frier;,0,1,,https://doi.org/10.4000/ambiances.886,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0020675649,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ATN0020675649&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Second, architects build alterable architectural patterns and spatial structures by considering surrounding landscapes an organism, not an inalterable thing.

Since the modern age, each different factor in landscape and urban circumstances had a large impact on contemporary architecture. Folding architecture after deconstruction architecture is a relatively new trend that shows characteristics of a pattern, space, and a structure, unlike any we have never seen before, with integrated and united interpretation of inner and outer factors in architecture. Outer factors related folding architecture are broad concepts embracing intangible landscapes such as memories of past, cultural heritages, and urbanism, in addition to physical contexts of areas and topography. This paper identifies tangible and intangible factors of landscapes centering selected cases and architectural features by the concept of folding, and with those results, the features of landscape interpretation are the following three things.First, tangible and intangible factors of landscape in the selected architecture are integrated and combined by inner factors like functions and structures, and forms and spatial structures. Second, architects build alterable architectural patterns and spatial structures by considering surrounding landscapes an organism, not an inalterable thing. Last, fold architecture considers modern urbanism a significant intangible factor, and recognizes that programs and events have an impact on the course of building architecture. With the results, those interpretations of urbanism become a driver of making the boundaries between the landscape and buildings blurred, and making inner space continuous and flexible.",박형진;이종석;,0,0,pp.227-236,http://dx.doi.org/,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001710596,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001710596&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Higher urbanization rates in cities may result in high temperature warming, which is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Recently, researchers have revealed pronounced effects based on HW and UHI interactions; however, studies that linked their effects with surface energy fluxes in different urban landscape and climate are still inadequate. This study utilized the Community Land Model (CLM) to assess the effect of HW towards UHI, while considering energy fluxes variations in Seoul, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and Melbourne, with different climate influences and urban morphologies. Generally, Seoul and Tokyo showed intense HW magnitude from 2000 to 2018 based on the HW indices. The surface energy flux components demonstrated a distinct pattern especially from 11:00 to 17:00, with the exception of sensible heat in Melbourne. Further energy-flux partitioning revealed that changes in the heat storage ratio were most significant in Seoul, with 1.39 partitioning due to its larger impervious area. A smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio of open mid-rise building has enhanced urban warming in Melbourne, whereas smaller impervious and larger pervious road fraction could mitigate urban warming effects in Kuala Lumpur. Seoul showed the highest changes in daytime UHI under HW at 2.01 &deg;C, due to the low convection efficiency in compact high-rise building, while nighttime UHI was highly influenced by heat storage and anthropogenic heat release.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Seoul and Tokyo have more intense heat waves (HWs) during 2000&ndash;2018. </LI> <LI>  Latent heat, heat storage, and net radiation changed consistently from 11:00 to 17:00 during HW events. </LI> <LI>  City that has compact building type contributed to the highest heat storage ratio. </LI> <LI>  Smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio enhanced urban warming under HWs. </LI> <LI>  Urban heat island was enhanced under HW occurrences. </LI> </UL> </P>","Mohammad Harmay, Nurul Syahira;Choi, Minha;",2,1,pp.108677,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108677,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117041401,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117041401&type=mobile,Heat waves .

It further explores the role of networked screen in the formation of a transnational creative cluster. Using a telematic large screen event staged across Melbourne and Seoul, the paper evaluates the responses of audiences to examine the politics of cultural and civic engagement. While scholarships on creative clusters predominantly focus on the new value chain of industrial and commercial production that arises as a result of agglomeration, this paper argues that the large screen possesses the capacity not only to invigorate public participation, but as a transnational creative cluster, the networked large screen also possesses the potential to enhance the quality of intercultural communication between Asia and Australia.","Yue, A.;McQuire, S.;Papastergiadis, N.;",2,1,pp.157-164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccs.2014.06.001,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70277933,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70277933&type=mobile,Large screen .

Concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere varied widely between the cities over the course of the study, ranging from a low of 24.1&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Melbourne during the winter to a high of 376.2&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Jakarta during the dry season. Seasonal variations in both TSP and PAH were observed in the tropical cities in the study with higher concentrations during the dry season and lower concentrations during the wet season. TSP and PAH concentrations are correlated with each other in these cities, suggesting that they have related sources and sinks for these cities. In the temperate cities of Melbourne and Seoul, PAH concentrations were higher during the cold winter season and lower during the warm summer. However, TSP was quite variable over the years in these latter cities and no clear seasonal trend was observed. A number of factors have been investigated which could be contributing to seasonal variations in pollutant levels. In the temperate climates, increased emissions due to the use of fossil fuels for heating in the winter is evident. However, an interrogation of the database with respect to the other factors such as (1)increased photolytic degradation during the summer, (2)transport of pollutants from other sources, (3)removal of PAH via wet deposition and in-cloud scavenging mechanisms and (4)volatilisation of lower molecular weight species during periods of high temperature indicates the importance of multiple processes. Even though there are clearly much lower levels of both particulates and PAH in the wet season of the tropical climates, no statistically significant correlations have been observed between rainfall levels and pollutant concentrations.</P>","Panther, B.C.;Hooper, M.A.;Tapper, N.J.;",2,1,pp.4087-4099,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(99)00150-8,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART21829519,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART21829519&type=mobile,TSP .

By carefully examining the accounts of ten former North Korean residents, the researchers find that the traditional socialist economy, once prevalent in workplaces, schools, and hospitals, has now been supplanted by individual-to-individual private market interactions.

McLaren (1882-1957) was an Australian Christian missionary and a professor of psychiatry in Korea. As the first psychiatrist from a Western country, he accomplished tremendous achievements in clinical, teaching and writing activities as well as in his missionary work. He graduated from the University of Melbourne in 1906 and, after residency training under Professor Dr. Sir Richard Stawell at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, he and his wife came to Korea in 1911. He practised medicine at Margaret Whitecross Paton Memorial Hospital in Chinju, Korea and later was appointed as a professor of psychiatry at the Severance Union Medical School in Seoul, Korea. He left Korea for a while to participate in WWII as a military doctor and he also once traveled to Vienna to learn new skills, including fever therapy and psychoanalysis. Because of his love for the Korean people, Dr. McLaren not only introduced into Korean society modern Western psychiatry and a humanitarian approach to patients with mental disorders, but he also practised medicine according to his own unique medical philosophy drawn from Christian spirituality and he educated Korean native students in psychiatry and Christianity. He and his wife also made efforts to improve old customs in Korean society. Because he argued against Japan’s enforcement of emperor-worship, he had to resign from the Severance Medical College in 1939, and he returned to Chinju. Immediately after the bombing of Pearl Harbour, he was arrested, imprisoned, interned, and subequently expelled to Australia in 1942. In Melbourne, received wide press coverage and great controversy. He lectured widely and contributed to various professional and other publications, covering not only subjects in Christianity and medicine/psychiatry, but also his opinions about the war and Japan, communism and the White Australia policy. As a Christian me-dical doctor and scientist, he was interested in the “nature of man”, the relationship or interaction between body (brain and/or material) and mind/spirituality, the origin of human consciousness in relation to time-space energy, the healing of disease, and the etiology of mental illness and spiritual treatment. He was passionate in his stated belief that God’s Word applied to the whole spec-trum of human relationships, from personal to international, as well as to the natural world. Dr. McLaren kept his conservative Christian beliefs, but he respected traditional Asian philosophies. His thoughts and experiences were publically expressed through lectures, journals and books, not only in Korea but also in China and Australia. He was a man of compassion, courage and ceaseless intellectual activity, a pioneer of psychiatry and a lifelong explorer of the Bible. Korean psych-iatrists, who may feel confused by the many complicated new medical theories and advanced technologies, still find Dr. McLaren’s simple and clear teachings on science, medicine, and human nature and his practice of caring for mental patients with a compassionate, humanitarian and Christian attitude a challenging example to emulate.",민성길,0,0,pp.172-186,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001633242,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001633242,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001633242&type=mobile,,,Melbourne Seoul

This study aimed to derive a comprehensive, whole&#8208;brain characterization of large&#8208;scale axonal connectivity differences in attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) associated with catechol&#8208;O&#8208;methyltransferase gene (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism. Using diffusion tensor imaging, whole&#8208;brain tractography, and an imaging connectomics approach, we characterized altered white matter connectivity in youth with ADHD who were COMT Val&#8208;homozygous (<I>N</I>&thinsp;=&thinsp;29) compared with those who were Met&#8208;carriers (<I>N</I>&thinsp;=&thinsp;29). Additionally, we examined whether dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) and dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) polymorphisms were associated with white matter differences. Level of attention was assessed using the continuous performance test before and after an 8&#8208;week open&#8208;label trial of methylphenidate (MPH). A network of white matter connections linking 18 different brain regions was significantly weakened in youth with ADHD who were COMT Met&#8208;carriers compared to those who were Val&#8208;homozygous (<I>P</I>&thinsp;<&thinsp;0.05, family&#8208;wise error&#8208;corrected). A measure of white matter integrity, fractional anisotropy, was correlated with impaired pretreatment performance in continuous performance test omission errors and response time variability, as well as with improvement in continuous performance test response time variability after MPH treatment. Altered white matter connectivity was exclusively based on COMT genotypes, and was not evident in DAT1 or DRD4. We demonstrated that white matter connectivity in youth with ADHD is associated with COMT Val158Met genotypes. The present findings suggest that different layers of dopamine&#8208;related genes and interindividual variability in the genetic polymorphisms should be taken into account when investigating the human connectome. <I>Hum Brain Mapp, 36:367&ndash;377, 2015</I>. &copy; <B>2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</B></P>","Hong, Soon&#x2010;Beom;Zalesky, Andrew;Park, Subin;Yang, Young&#x2010;Hui;Park, Min&#x2010;Hyeon;Kim, BoAh;Song, In&#x2010;Chan;Sohn, Chul&#x2010;Ho;Shin, Min&#x2010;Sup;Kim, Bung&#x2010;Nyun;Cho, Soo&#x2010;Churl;Kim, Jae&#x2010;Won;",2,1,pp.367-377,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.22634,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70983995,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70983995&type=mobile,attention&#x2010;deficit/hyperactivity disorder . catechol&#x2010;O&#x2010;methyltransferase . diffusion tensor imaging . methylphenidate . white matter;,,Melbourne Seoul

FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase over-expressed in pancreatic cancer, where it contributes to cell survival, proliferation, migration and chemoresistance and thus plays a key role in tumor growth, FAK also contributes to multiple mechanisms underlying fibrosis and immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Narmafotinib has successfully completed a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers where the drug was safe and well tolerated with pharmacokinetics consistent with once-a-day dosing. A Phase 1b/2a trial of narmafotinib, in combination with gemcitabine and Abraxane, in advanced pancreatic cancer patients - the ACCENT trial - is currently underway in Australia and South Korea. Methods: The ACCENT trial (NCT05355298) is a Phase 1b/2a, open label study of the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, and efficacy of narmafotinibin combination with gemcitabine and Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) standard of care as first-line therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The trial is a single-arm open label study conducted in two stages. In Part A, patients were enrolled in a 3+3 design to determine the narmafotinib recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), with narmafotinibdose-escalation (100, 200 and 400 mg). Safety and tolerability were assessed according to incidence and severity of adverse events. Narmafotinibplasma PK samples were collected on Days -8, -7, 1, 3, 8, and 10 of Run-In/Cycle 1. Imaging was conducted every 2 months. Part B of the trial is a Simon&rsquo;s two stage design, with the primary objectives of assessing safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the combination using RECIST v1.1. Results: Preliminary analysis across all doses (14 patients) showed narmafotinib to be generally safe and well-tolerated and showed promising signs of efficacy. All patients who completed their first 28-day cycle of treatment elected to stay on narmafotinib and 9/14 patients have remained on trial for 5 months or more. There have been 6 confirmed PRs (4 in 400 mg cohort; 2 in 200 mg cohort) as best response. A single DLT was reported: uncontrolled grade 3 nausea (400 mg cohort). Fatigue, grade 3 or below related to narmafotinib occurred in more than one participant. The PK for narmafotinib is dose-proportional across the dose range tested, and the chemotherapy regimen used in this study did not impact narmafotinib PK. Safety, tolerability and efficacy data continues to be collected and will be presented. Conclusions: Based on this promising Phase 1b data, 400 mg of narmafotinib has been selected for the RP2D and Part B of the trial is now underway and recruiting patients in Australia and South Korea. The trial will enrol up to 50 patients as part of the Phase 2 expansion cohort.

Phylogenetic relationships among 45 ceramialean taxa, including eight ceramiacean, 18 dasyacean, nine delesseriacean, eight rhodomelacean species and two of uncertain affiliation, based on 34 anatomical characters and nuclear small&#x2010;subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences were determined. Results from our &lsquo;total&#x2010;evidence&rsquo; approach were consistent with the notion that the Dasyaceae, Delesseriaceae and Rho&#x2010; domelaceae have evolved from a common ancestor within a paraphyletic Ceramiaceae. Our data indicate, however, that the Rhodomelaceae alone was monophyletic with the Dasyaceae unequivocally polyphyletic and the Delesseriaceae either polyphyletic, or paraphyletic in excluding the Dasya&#x2010;group. Based on our results the Heterosiphoniaceae fam. nov. H.&#x2010;G. Choi, Kraft, I.K. Lee et G.W. Saunders is proposed for the Heterosiphonia&#x2010;group, previously placed in the family Dasyaceae. Although the Dasyaceae sensu stricto is a natural group, it is in need of a thorough systematic investigation at the generic level.

Human tumor necrosis factor-&alpha; (hTNF-&alpha;) is one of the essential mediators of AHXR and induces activation of porcine endothelial cells (PECs), resulting in upregulation of major histocompatibility complex molecules, adhesion molecules, and proinflammatory chemokines. We investigated whether introduction of a soluble human tumor necrosis factor receptor I-Fc (shTNFRI-Fc) fusion gene can suppress activation of PECs and, more importantly, produced shTNFRI-Fc transgenic pigs. METHODS.: The shTNFRI-Fc gene expression vector was constructed and inserted into PECs. The inhibitory effects of shTNFRI-Fc were tested by luciferase assay, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry. A shTNFRI-Fc transgenic pig was generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer. The expression of shTNFRI-Fc in the transgenic pig was evaluated by PCR, western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunohistochemistry. The inhibitory effects of shTNFRI-Fc in the serum obtained from the transgenic pig were also tested. RESULTS.: In comparison with control green fluorescent protein, shTNFRI-Fc protein showed much stronger inhibitory effects on NF-&kgr;B activation in the HEK293-NF-&kgr;B-luciferase reporting cell line, expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules in PECs, and TNF-&alpha;-mediated cytotoxicity. We successfully generated shTNFRI-Fc transgenic pig. Sera obtained from the transgenic pig inhibited induction of chemokines, and E-selectin in PECs stimulated with Human TNF-&alpha;. CONCLUSIONS.: We have generated transgenic pigs producing shTNFRI-Fc protein that can inhibit TNF-&alpha;-mediated activation of PECs. Because TNF-&alpha; is an important mediator of xenograft rejection, the use of xenografts that can produce shTNFRI-Fc proteins de novo could be an effective approach in overcoming a considerable component of the xenograft rejection process, especially AHXR.","Cho, Bumrae;Koo, Ok Jae;Hwang, Jong-Ik;Kim, Hwajung;Lee, Eun Mi;Hurh, Sunghoon;Park, Sol Ji;Ro, Han;Yang, Jaeseok;Surh, Charles D.;d’Apice, Anthony J.;Lee, Byeong Chun;Ahn, Curie;",2,1,pp.139-147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/TP.0b013e3182215e7e,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART56940064,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART56940064&type=mobile,,,Melbourne Seoul

A total of 581 women who were <I>BRCA</I> carriers (222 <I>BRCA1</I> and 359 <I>BRCA2</I>), 1,083 non-carriers with FH, and 886 non-carriers with early-onset BC were enrolled and interviewed to examine the reproductive factors, from 2007 to 2014. The hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) in the weighted Cox regression model were used to calculate the BC risk based on the reproductive factors. Earlier menarche increased BC risk by 3.49-fold in <I>BRCA2</I> mutation carriers (95%CI=2.03&#x2013;6.00) and 3.30-fold in non-carriers with FH (95%CI=1.73&#x2013;6.34), but was insignificantly associated with <I>BRCA1</I> carriers and non-carriers for early-onset BC (P-heterogeneity=0.047).

Results showed that, in both countries, past and present national identifications are correlated but empirically distinct constructs, which independently contribute to general national identification. Past and present national identifications were also shown to be grounded in distinct notions of national continuity. Most importantly, in both countries, present national identification positively predicted favourable attitudes towards social changes and globalization, whereas past national identification negatively predicted these attitudes.

Theoretically, SCA compliant SDRs are supposed to have the capability of self-configuring and switching from one wireless protocol to any other. However, conventional SDRs running standard upper layer protocol stack fail to switch wireless protocols on the fly retaining all the connections and incur large delay. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for wireless protocol switching that is free from these problems. We base our approach on dual or multiple antennas operable by SDR software. The main contribution of this paper is the hot swapping middleware (HSM) that ensures seamless switching between wireless protocols without affecting the application performance. HSM manages IP addressing issues transparently and ensures in order delivery of data packets without loss. Our proposal is free from any requirement of infrastructure support, light weight and easily SCA component upgradable. Simulation results show that our proposal improves the total data transfer of applications in an SDR by more than 25%.

Motivated by this, a new power saving mechanism called the sleep-transmit mode (STM) is proposed, which enables the optical network units (ONUs) at customer premises to transmit upstream data during sleep periods without turning on the receiver, thus conserving energy and improving upstream transmission delay. These advantages are achieved by pre-allocating bandwidth for upstream transmission to ONU before it enters the sleep state. Our analysis results show that using STM (1) the power consumption of an ONU is reduced by up to 29% compared to interrupting the sleep mode, and (2) the average additional upstream packet delay due to sleep mode is reduced by up to 10-fold compared to transmitting the upstream packets only after the sleep duration expires.</P>","Li, Jie;Anthapadmanabhan, N.

PLC-&#946;1 transduces intracellular signals from specific muscarinic, glutamate and serotonin receptors, all of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Here, we present data to show that PLC-&#946;1 knockout mice display locomotor hyperactivity, sensorimotor gating deficits as well as cognitive impairment. These changes in behavior are regarded as endophenotypes homologous to schizophrenia-like symptoms in rodents. Importantly, the locomotor hyperactivity and sensorimotor gating deficits in PLC-&#946;1 knockout mice are subject to beneficial modulation by environmental enrichment. Furthermore, clozapine but not haloperidol (atypical and typical antipsychotics, respectively) rescues the sensorimotor gating deficit in these animals, suggesting selective predictive validity. We also demonstrate a relationship between the beneficial effects of environmental enrichment and levels of M1&#47;M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding in the neocortex and hippocampus.

To address these issues, we conduct a series of meta-analytic examination. First, using a sample of 208 effect sizes from 51 studies covering multiple industries across 10 countries, we test how two distinct types of diversity (task- and relations-oriented diversity) are differentially associated with two types of emergent team processes (information elaboration and social categorization) in TMTs. Second, meta-analytic regression analyses are conducted to examine how national culture (power distance and collectivism) and industry characteristics (munificence and dynamism) influence the diversity effects on emergent team processes. Third, we conduct a structural equation modeling analysis to examine the relationships among diversity (input)-information elaboration and social categorization-based processes (mediators)-firm performance (output), incorporating additional 895 effect sizes from 152 studies. Our findings indicate that while relations-oriented diversity has apparent relationships with social categorization-based processes, task-oriented diversity is strongly associated with both information elaboration and social categorization-based processes. Industry munificence and dynamism as well as collectivism in national culture moderate the diversity-social categorization relationships. The result of structural equation modeling also confirms the mediating paths of the TMT diversity-information elaboration/social categorization-performance links. </P>","Roh, Hyuntak;Chun, Kyungmi;Ryou, Yeejeong;Son, Jooyeon;",2,1,pp.112-164,https://doi.org/10.1177/1059601118799475,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART95542810,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART95542810&type=mobile,,,Melbourne Seoul

Some research has analysed the effects of the pandemic on air quality; however, very few studies have employed relationship analytics. In order to analyse the potential relationship between pandemic-related information and air quality data from a more holistic and detailed point of view, we propose a methodology based on pure data analysis. Three types of data were collected, namely air quality index, pandemic-related events, and number of COVID cases. Data were collected from five cities-Wuhan, New York, Seoul, Melbourne, and Singapore-to further analyse the response of air quality index to COVID events, thus revealing how human activity influences air quality from a pandemic perspective. The results show that a potential connection does exist in most cases and provide more evidence showing that air pollution declined during the pandemic. However, the strength of this relationship may also be related to other factors, such as geography, politics, population density, and measures imposed by local authorities, etc. This study provides another perspective to assist stakeholders in improving environmental decision making.</P>","Chi, Xin;Hua, Jie;Hua, Shuyang;Ren, Xiao;Yang, Shuanghe;",2,1,pp.181,https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos13020181,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117863868,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117863868&type=mobile,,,Melbourne Seoul

The first technique, joint multitarget tracking, enumerates and evaluates all feasible global measurement to track assignments resulting in a conditionally optimal but potentially computationally expensive technique. The second technique, linear multitarget (LM), achieves multitarget functionality by modulating clutter measurement density. LM is a suboptimal, but computationally very efficient technique.

Accurate diagnosis is critical as onychomycosis is transmissible between humans and impacts patients' quality of life. Combining clinical examination with mycological testing ensures accurate diagnosis. Conventional diagnostic techniques, including potassium hydroxide testing, fungal culture and histopathology of nail clippings, detect fungal species within nails. New diagnostic tools have been developed recently which either improve detection of onychomycosis clinically, including dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy and artificial intelligence, or mycologically, such as molecular assays. Dermoscopy is cost-effective and non-invasive, allowing clinicians to discern microscopic features of onychomycosis and fungal melanonychia. Reflectance confocal microscopy enables clinicians to observe bright filamentous septate hyphae at near histologic resolution by the bedside. Artificial intelligence may prompt patients to seek further assessment for nails that are suspicious for onychomycosis.

This means that their state may reflect not only recent climatic conditions but also climatic conditions in past years or even decades. Here we demonstrate that five commonly used conceptual &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; rainfall&#x2010;runoff models are unable to replicate multiyear trends exhibited by natural systems during the &ldquo;Millennium Drought&rdquo; in south&#x2010;east Australia. This causes an inability to extrapolate to different climatic conditions, leading to poor performance in split sample tests. Simulations are examined from five models applied in 38 catchments, then compared with groundwater data from 19 bores and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment data for two geographic regions. Whereas the groundwater and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment data decrease from high to low values gradually over the duration of the 13&#x2010;year drought, the model storages go from high to low values in a typical seasonal cycle. This is particularly the case in the drier, flatter catchments. Once the drought begins, there is little room for decline in the simulated storage, because the model &ldquo;buckets&rdquo; are already &ldquo;emptying&rdquo; on a seasonal basis. Since the effects of sustained dry conditions cannot accumulate within these models, we argue that they should not be used for runoff projections in a drying climate. Further research is required to (a) improve conceptual rainfall&#x2010;runoff models, (b) better understand circumstances in which multiyear trends in state variables occur, and (c) investigate links between these multiyear trends and changes in rainfall&#x2010;runoff relationships in the context of a changing climate.</P></P></▼1><▼2><P><B>Key Points</B><P><P>Environmental state variables such as groundwater display multiyear trends in response to sustained climate anomalies</P><P>We show that five commonly used conceptual &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; rainfall runoff models are unable to replicate such trends</P><P>Because of this, the models fail to extrapolate realistically to different climatic conditions, compromising runoff projections</P></P></P></▼2><▼3><P><B>Plain Language Summary</B><P>It is common in science to use a mental picture or metaphor that simplifies a complex phenomenon. A common metaphor used for a water supply catchment is that of a leaky bucket. When it rains, the bucket fills up; when it does not rain for a while, the bucket empties due to evaporation and water used by trees; and leaking water is like river flow. Computer models based on variants of this metaphor are common and can provide predictions of how much streamflow might occur under future scenarios. This paper explores limitations of the bucket metaphor and associated models. Recently, during a 13&#x2010;year drought in Australia, river catchments gradually started to dry up. With each passing year, the depth to groundwater increased gradually as the water used by trees was not replenished by rainfall. We compare this long, slow behavior to that of five commonly used &ldquo;bucket&rdquo; models. The models do not show the long, slow drying up-they only show the seasonal ups and downs, and their predictions of streamflow over the drought are poor. This is surprising, and it means we should choose our models carefully and seek out models that can simulate this behavior and its impact on streamflow.</P></P></▼3>","Fowler, Keirnan;Knoben, Wouter;Peel, Murray;Peterson, Tim;Ryu, Dongryeol;Saft, Margarita;Seo, Ki&#x2010;Weon;Western, Andrew;",2,1,pp.e2019WR025286,https://doi.org/10.1029/2019wr025286,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART107614538,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART107614538&type=mobile,,,Melbourne Seoul

We observe that the energy consumption by false wakeups (i.e., wakeup without receiving any packet) of a node in noisy environments can be a dominant factor in many cases while the false wakeup rate is spatially and temporarily dynamic. Based on this observation, without carefully considering the impact of false wakeups, the energy efficient performance of LPL nodes in noisy environments may significantly deviate from the optimal performance. To address this problem, we propose a theoretical framework incorporating LPL temporal parameters with the false wakeup rate and the data rate. We then formulate an energy consumption minimization problem of LPL in noisy environments and address the problem by a simplified and practical approach. Based on the theoretical framework, we design an efficient adaptive protocol for LPL (APL) in noisy environments. Through extensive experimental studies with Telosb nodes in real environments, we show that APL achieves 20&#x0025;&#x2013;40&#x0025; energy efficient improvement compared to existing LPL protocols under various network conditions.</P>","Dinh, Thanh;Kim, Younghan;Gu, Tao;Vasilakos, Athanasios V.;",2,1,pp.2162-2173,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2017.2720781,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART90646081,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART90646081&type=mobile,,,Melbourne Seoul

Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), in contrast to traditional mycological testing, is a noninvasive, point-of-care tool that can rapidly identify fungal lesions. This systematic review aims to understand the utility of RCM in evaluating onychomycosis and follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A systematic search of four databases was conducted. A total of five articles&#x2014;three prospective cohort studies and two case reports&#x2014;which reported RCM findings in nails clinically suspicious for onychomycosis were analyzed. Fungal hyphae or spores were visualized on RCM in 67 (81.7%) of the 82 mycologically confirmed cases of onychomycosis. Terms used to describe hyphae included bright, linear, lengthy, thready-like, branching and filamentous. Spores were described as bright, roundish structures with high reflection. The three cohort studies demonstrated RCM had a sensitivity of 52.9&#x2013;91.7, a specificity of 57.58&#x2013;90.2%, a positive predictive value of 61.1&#x2013;88.6% and a negative predictive value of 68.0&#x2013;90.5%. In conclusion, existing studies demonstrate how RCM can assist the diagnosis of onychomycosis at the bedside.

However, it was poorly predicted by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's operational seasonal climate forecast system of that time, ACCESS&#x2010;S1, even at a short lead time of a month. Using the current operational forecast system, ACCESS&#x2010;S2, we have, therefore, tried to find a primary cause of the limited predictability of this event and conducted forecast sensitivity experiments to understand the potential role of ozone in the event and its associated anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and rainfall over south-eastern Australia and western Patagonia. Here, we show that the 2020 strong vortex event did not follow the canonical dynamical evolution seen in previous strong vortex events in spring but suddenly appeared as a result of the record&#x2010;low upward propagating wave activity in September 2020. The ACCESS&#x2010;S2 forecasts significantly underestimated the negative wave forcing in September even at zero lead time, irrespective of the ozone configuration, therefore falling short in predicting the record strength of the polar vortex in late spring 2020. Nevertheless, ACCESS&#x2010;S2 with prescribed realistic ozone that had large anomalies in the Antarctic stratosphere significantly better predicted the strong vortex and the subsequent positive SAM and related rainfall anomalies over south-eastern Australia and western Patagonia in the austral summer of 2020-21. This highlights the potentially important role of ozone variations for seasonal climate forecasting as a source of long&#x2010;lead predictability.</P></P></P></▼1><▼2><P><B>Plain Language Summary</B><P><P>The Antarctic vortex of October-December 2020 was the strongest on record in the satellite observation era for that season when monitored at 60&deg;S in the mid&#x2010; to lower stratosphere (altitudes of 15-30 km). However, this super vortex event was poorly predicted by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM)'s seasonal climate forecast system even at 1&#x2010;month lead time. We argue that the 2020 strong vortex was likely caused by an abrupt reduction in the upward propagating wave activity from the troposphere in September 2020, which left the stratospheric vortex undisturbed and strong. The BoM seasonal forecast system substantially underpredicted the negative wave forcing in September 2020, resulting in a poor forecast performance for the vortex strength in the following season. Forecast experiments prescribed with observed versus climatological ozone concentrations further show that using the observed ozone, characterized by a significant loss over Antarctica in spring 2020, improved the ensemble mean forecasts for the 2020 vortex strength by &sim;10%-20% at different levels of the stratosphere and the associated surface climate features such as the poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude jet and anomalously high rainfall over south-eastern Australia and low rainfall over western Patagonia in the following summer.</P></P></P></▼2><▼3><P><B>Key Points</B><P><P>The Antarctic vortex of 2020 was the strongest event in the satellite era for the October-December mean in the mid&#x2010; to lower stratosphere</P><P>Significant lack of tropospheric wave forcing in September 2020 was responsible for the sudden appearance of the record strong polar vortex</P><P>Imposing realistic ozone concentrations significantly improved forecasts of the 2020 polar vortex strength and its downward impact</P></P></P></▼3>","Lim, Eun&#x2010;Pa;Zhou, Linjing;Young, Griffith;Abhik, S.;Rudeva, Irina;Hope, Pandora;Wheeler, Matthew C.;Arblaster, Julie M.;Hendon, Harry H.;Manney, Gloria L.;Son, Seok&#x2010;Woo;Oh, Jiyoung;Garreaud, Ren&eacute;D.;",2,1,pp.e2024JD040820,https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jd040820,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132288388,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132288388&type=mobile,,,Melbourne Seoul

To our best knowledge, this is first report from use of 5-ALA in a deep sylvian meningioma.","Chae, Michael P.;Song, Sang Woo;Park, Sung-Hye;Park, Chul-Kee;",2,1,pp.558-560,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2012.52.6.558,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIFullTextView?cn=JAKO201208456389499&dbt=JAKO&keyValue=05787966,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201208456389499,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201208456389499&type=mobile,5-aminolevulinic acid .

Conventionally, chiro&#x2010;optic experiments have demonstrated interactions between circularly polarized light and materials. However, employing light with chiral phase, i.e., optical vortex, can generate a strong chiral response and holds the potential to unveil extensive material information owing to the infinite topological numbers. In this work, an array of 3D chiral nanoparticles is employed to demonstrate large helical dichroism (HD). Chiral gold nanoparticle arrays are illuminated by vortex beams of opposite helicity, which revealed the high HD value of 0.93. The chiral interaction is theoretically investigated, and enantioselective interaction can be explained by multipole analysis. It is determined that the strong HD is attributed to the interaction of higher&#x2010;order multipole moments such as electric quadrupole and magnetic quadrupole moments.

Objective: To investigate whether the risk of dementia differs according to the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs, and compare the effects of antipsychotic agents on dementia risk in individuals with late-life depressive disorders. Methods: A nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the National Health Insurance Service-Senior Cohort of South Korea. Atypical antipsychotic dosages were standardized using a defined daily dose, and the cumulative dosage was calculated. Participants were observed from January 2008 to December 2015. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratios. Results: The cohort included 43,788 elderly adults with depressive disorders: 9,901 participants (22.6%) were diagnosed with dementia. Findings showed that atypical antipsychotics were prescribed to 1,967 participants (4.5%). Compared with non-users, users of atypical antipsychotics experienced a significantly higher risk for dementia with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.541 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.415-1.678).

This control is formulated using the soil moisture stress function (SSF), where the evaporative fraction (EF) or the fraction of the AET to PET (fPET) is assumed to be either a linear or a non-linear function of soil moisture. We examine the effectiveness of the soil moisture stress function to quantify soil moisture control on EF or fPET over a dryland wheat field in Victoria, Australia. Micrometeorological observations from two cropping seasons were used for the analysis. The efficacy of a root-density-weighted soil moisture estimate in predicting EF and fPET was investigated as against the commonly assumed fixed-depth root zone soil moisture. However, results indicate a strong relationship between EF and available soil water fraction (AWF) in the root zone only when solar radiation is higher than 5 MJ/m(2)/day. As the rooting depth increases with vegetation growth, SSF exhibits the strongest correlation with AWF for increasing soil profile depth. In the early and harvesting crop growth stages, ET is constrained mostly by surface soil moisture (0-5 cm). In the mid-growth stages, ET is strongly influenced by soil moisture in the root zone (0-60 cm). The shape of SSF, however, changes significantly between the two years (2012 and 2013). It is inferred that different temporal rainfall patterns between the years caused wheat's different response to water stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Gender Differences in Professional Tennis,"<P>This article examines line-call challenges by male and female professional tennis players in major tournaments around the world. In terms of utilization rates, we find that the genders behave similarly. Nevertheless, we do detect some intriguing gender differences in these challenges. First, male players&#x2019; challenges are more likely to be provoked by those of their opponents. More importantly, at tiebreaks, females are more likely to reverse an umpire&#x2019;s unfavorable call, while males make relatively more unsuccessful challenges. Furthermore, we find that men are a lot more likely to make &#x201C;embarrassing&#x201D; line-call challenges at tiebreaks and offenses (i.e., when the shot lands at the opponent&#x2019;s side of the tennis court) than women. These significant gender differences suggest that women particularly diverge from men at crucial junctures of the match such as tiebreaks. Differences in factors such as risk aversion, overconfidence, pride, shame, and strategic signalling behavior might help us to explain these gender-difference findings in line call challenges.</P>","Anbarci, Nejat;Lee, Jungmin;Ulker, Aydogan;",2,1,pp.323-353,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1527002514531788,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART75278403,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART75278403&type=mobile,gender differences . professional tennis . high stakes . line call challenges,,Melbourne Seoul

The experience that one's self is context-sensitive may be universal, however the amount and meaning of context-sensitive self vary across cultures. Cross-cultural differences in the amount and meaning of context-sensitive self were investigated in three Western cultures (Australia, Germany, and UK) and two East Asian cultures (Japan and Korea). The amount of context-sensitivity of self was greater in Japan than in Western cultures and Korea. The meaning of context-sensitive self also varied across cultures. In the Western cultures, a context-invariant self was seen to be clear and true; however, these patterns were not observed in the East Asian cultures. In Korea, a context-invariant self was interpreted to be exhibiting a relational self, which adheres to the ethics of care. In Japan, it was a context-sensitive self that was seen to be true, implying that the true self in Japan may mean to be true to the self-in-context, rather than the transcendental, decontextualized self.

On the one hand, this trend suggests significant opportunities for healthcare providers due to increasing service demand. On the other hand, it also implies that the industry requires new managerial knowledge to accommodate older adult consumers. In this research, we propose and examine the impact of older adult consumers on healthcare provider performance and identify boundary conditions related to two types of competition: intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;competition. Using longitudinal data on healthcare provider revenues, we find that an increase in the older adult population increases the revenues of generalists but decreases those of specialists. Second, the positive effect of elderly consumers on generalists is amplified when intra&#8208;competition (from same&#8208;type physicians) increases and diminishes when inter&#8208;competition (from different&#8208;type physicians) intensifies. Third, for specialist healthcare providers, the negative impact of older adult population is mitigated by intra&#8208;competition but exacerbated when inter&#8208;competition becomes strong. Our results offer theoretical implications for the healthcare service marketing literature and managerial insights into decisions related to healthcare service locations. Specifically, our findings suggest that healthcare providers need to carefully consider the proportion of older adult consumers, the presence of local competitors, and their own specialties, as these factors all have a meaningful impact on performance.</P>","Kim, Jeeyeon;Jo, Wooyong;Kim, Alex Jiyoung;Choi, Jeonghye;",2,1,pp.e13007,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcs.13007,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART128529219,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART128529219&type=mobile,competition . generalist . healthcare service . older adults . specialist,,Melbourne Seoul

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>The cases revealed 5 guidelines for moving from conceiving KTA systems to
implementing them: 1) establish and nurture relationships, 2) co-produce and curate
knowledge, 3) create feedback loops, 4) frame as systems interventions rather than
projects, and 5) consider variations across time and place.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Results from the environmental scan are a modest start to translating
systems concepts for KTA into practice. Use of the strategies revealed in the scan may
improve KTA for solving complex public health problems. The strategies themselves will
benefit from the development of a science that aims to understand adaptation and
ongoing learning from policy and practice interventions, strengthens enduring
relationships, and fills system gaps in addition to evidence gaps. Systems approaches
to KTA will also benefit from robust evaluations.</p>

The Knowledge to Action (KTA) Framework was developed in Canada by Graham and colleagues in the 2000s, following a review of 31 planned action theories. The framework has two components: Knowledge Creation and an Action Cycle, each of which comprises multiple phases. This review sought to answer two questions: ‘Is the KTA Framework used in practice?

The index citation for the original paper was identified on three databases&#x2014;Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar&#x2014;with the facility for citation searching. Limitations of English language and year of publication 2006-June 2013 were set. A taxonomy categorising the continuum of usage was developed.

It is frequently cited, with usage ranging from simple attribution via a reference, through informing planning, to making an intellectual contribution.

The aim of this study was to examine housing and support needs and preferences of people with MS with the intention to inform the planning of a co-designed intervention based on the study&rsquo;s findings. Methods Using the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework, quantitative (n = 79) and qualitative (n = 6) data from people with MS were extracted and integrated from projects completed by the research team that explored the housing and support needs and preferences of people with disability. Results were synthesised and presented to a reference group for validation, contextualisation, and adaptation to the Australian context. Results High physical support needs were common across participants. People most commonly required home modifications to improve accessibility, such as ramps, equipment such as heating and cooling, and assistive technology. Many people required more than 8 hours per day of paid support. Moving into individualised housing facilitated independence and community reintegration. People reported gaps between what they wanted from support workers and what they received, citing individual and systemic barriers. Conclusion People with MS have support needs that require proactive and responsive funding arrangements, housing design and support provision.

The study has gained the following results: First, the most frequent words related to Taekwondo education were children, and clusters were derived from character education, objects/programs, research, and others. In addition, to strengthen the competitiveness of the Taekwondo education sector, Taekwondo character training programs should be strengthened, and conservative training to strengthen the capacity of Taekwondo leaders should be systematically implemented, and Taekwondo should be positioned as an alternative education to prevent violence. Second, Kukkiwon had the highest number of empty words related to the Taekwondo system, and clusters were derived from Kukkiwon/KTA, Taekwondo Promotion Foundation, World Taekwondo Federation and Judging System. Therefore, to strengthen the competitiveness of the Taekwondo system, the division of roles should be adjusted according to the purpose of establishing the Taekwondo related organization, and then various projects should be promoted.

While researchers have conducted systematic reviews on a range of software-based information and communication technologies as well as other social media (eg, virtual communities of practice, virtual peer-to-peer communities, and electronic support groups), none have reviewed collaborative writing applications in the medical sector. The overarching goal of this project is to explore the depth and breadth of evidence for the use of collaborative writing applications in health care. Thus, the purposes of this scoping review will be to (1) map the literature on collaborative writing applications; (2) compare the applications’ features; (3) describe the evidence of each application’s positive and negative effects as a KT intervention in health care; (4) inventory and describe the barriers and facilitators that affect the applications’ use; and (5) produce an action plan and a research agenda. A six-stage framework for scoping reviews will be used: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies within the selected databases (using the EPPI-Reviewer software to classify the studies); (3) selecting studies (an iterative process in which two reviewers search the literature, refine the search strategy, and review articles for inclusion); (4) charting the data (using EPPI-Reviewer’s data-charting form); (5) collating, summarizing, and reporting the results (performing a descriptive, numerical, and interpretive synthesis); and (6) consulting knowledge users during three planned meetings. Since this scoping review concerns the use of collaborative writing applications as KT interventions in health care, we will use the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework to describe and compare the various studies and collaborative writing projects we find. In addition to guiding the use of collaborative writing applications in health care, this scoping review will advance the science of KT by testing tools that could be used to evaluate other social media. We also expect to identify areas that require further systematic reviews and primary research and to produce a highly relevant research agenda that explores and leverages the potential of collaborative writing software. To date, this is the first study to use the KTA framework to study the role collaborative writing applications in KT, and the first to involve three national and international institutional knowledge users as part of the research process.</P>","Archambault, Patrick Michel;van de Belt, Tom H;Grajales III, Francisco J;Eysenbach, Gunther;Aubin, Karine;Gold, Irving;Gagnon, Marie-Pierre;Kuziemsky, Craig E;Turgeon, Alexis F;Poitras, Julien;Faber, Marjan J;Kremer, Jan A.M;Heldoorn, Marcel;Bilodeau, Andrea;L&eacute;gar&eacute;, France;",2,1,pp.e1,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/resprot.1993,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART69831999,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART69831999&type=mobile,,,KTA projects

ART003066051,JAKO,,한국공간디자인학회,한국공간디자인학회 논문집,;;,,,19,2,2024,,ART003066051,Analyzing Public Access and Boundary Utilization in Landscape Architecture,"(Background and Purpose) In contemporary society, Landscape Architecture crucially addresses the relationships between architecture and landscape, as well as individual and public realms within cities, establishing boundaries as areas with potential for communication while maintaining continuity between buildings and land. Despite the existence of developments ranging from single buildings to large-scale urban projects, many boundary and green spaces are currently applied in cities in isolated and passive ways, with limited functionality in terms of accessibility and publicness. Furthermore, the potential of Landscape Architecture to function diversely within urban environments is underutilized due to a lack of research on its boundary components and methods, compounded by uniform regulations. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes using the boundary spaces of buildings as a solution to practical urban problems, examining the construction methods and components of Landscape Architecture's boundary spaces to advance the concept of 'publicness' in both current and future architectural developments. (Method) This research employs case studies to examine the integration methods of Landscape Architecture within urban conditions, leveraging landscape concepts to bridge diverse aspects and elements. The study emphasizes the critical elements of Landscape Architecture, such as the rates of 'open area' and 'openness,' by investigating international architectural projects. These case studies are instrumental in understanding the types, access, efficiency, and rates of open areas, which are pivotal in expressing the public usage of Landscape Architectures numerically. (Results) The boundary spaces of Landscape Architecture, reflecting the urban context and locality, have shown high potential for public use and were categorized for analysis accordingly. This study introduced an innovative 'publicness graph,' linking objective indicators like 'public area ratio' and 'openness' to visualize detailed characteristics. By defining the Public Occupancy Index (POI) and Balance Deviation Index (BDI), the study quantitatively categorized the 'publicness' of individual buildings, which had previously been expressed qualitatively. (Conclusions) The study concludes that Landscape Architecture holds the potential to revolutionize the design and functionality of public spaces within urban landscapes. Through case analysis and conceptual establishment of the use of boundary spaces in landscape architecture, a quantitative analysis method has been presented. By applying the types of 'Street type', 'Park type', and 'Street + Park type' as case studies, the validity of the analytical method that quantifies the individual characteristics of buildings associated with publicness proposed in this paper has been confirmed. The analysis method based on the 'Publicness Graph' is expected to contribute significantly to the development of design plans and models that can optimize the public use of increasingly complex boundary spaces in modern architecture.",장재우;이상윤;,0,0,pp.107-120,http://dx.doi.org/10.35216/kisd.2024.19.2.107,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003066051,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003066051,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003066051&type=mobile,,,public architecture

Since sustainability is linked to public values, research on sustainable public spaces is an important way to secure sustainability in cities. Based on this, we analyzed the sustainability of European cities by examining the design methods of public architecture according to the region. The aim of the study is to derive architectural methodology corresponding to local characteristics, and to suggest issues to consider in public architecture design to promote urban sustainability based on this. First, regarding the environmental aspect, it can be observed that there is an effort to secure sustainability. Second, in terms of social sustainability, historical value remains as a trace of architectural place, so that it continues in people&rsquo;s memory. In addition, public architecture provides public places where citizens can gather and enjoy programs, while the architectural methods showed differences influenced by cultural conditions. Third, in economic sustainability, it was shown that energy saving was achieved through cost reduction through recycling of materials, facilities, or environmental factors. In conclusion, the issues to be considered in public architectural design are the voiding of urban space through architectural devices in the construction method. In other words, the intention is to form &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that attempts to be part of the city, and thereby create better places. Since skin and material have a deep relationship with the environment, they should have the durability and an outer skin that are suitable for the regional environment. Finally, sustainability is to be utilized through the influx of programs that meet local and environmental characteristics. Design research into public architecture that is oriented towards urban sustainability will be a task to be carried out by the present generation for the millennial generation.</P>","Kim, Soomi;Kwon, Hyun-ah;",2,1,pp.1249,https://doi.org/10.3390/su10041249,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART90662159,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART90662159&type=mobile,,,public architecture

Cell-based technology appears first in the form of point-to-point high-speed data trunks and then as switched high-speed access. Centralized cell switching will provide interconnect between cell-based trunks and shared access lines.

Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Computing are two of the most common approaches under consistently under consideration by organisations. Moreover, the two domains are becoming integral components of the Digital transformation agenda. However, existing literature shows that most research focuses on studying Enterprise Architecture and Cloud Computing as separate domains despite their fast convergence. This study presents findings from considering the converged critical success factors of applying Enterprise Architecture to cloud computing adoption in the public sector. The research deployed a modified Delphi technique to identify essential elements of success from twenty-one experts based in Korea and Botswana. The study utilised Technology-Organisation-Environment (TOE) and cohesion analysis on factors identified by experts to propose a novel factor classification model composed of Service Design, EA Capability, Organisation and Economic factors. The findings further showed that Organisational and Economic factors exhibit a moderating effect on Cloud Computing adoption.

Methods: The CDC facilitated multiple Proof-of-Concept (PoC) projects, leveraging an open-source-based software development methodology, to test four hypotheses with regard to this high-level framework. The outcomes of the four PoCs in combination with the use of the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) and the newly emerging Federal Segment Architecture Methodology (FSAM) was used to develop and refine a high-level architectural framework for a Public Health Grid infrastructure. Results: The authors were successful in documenting a robust high-level architectural framework for a PHGrid. The documentation generated provided a level of granularity needed to validate the proposal, and included examples of both information standards and services to be implemented. Both the results of the PoCs as well as feedback from selected public health partners were used to develop the granular documentation. Conclusions: A robust high-level cohesive architectural framework for a Public Health Grid (PHGrid) has been successfully articulated, with its feasibility demonstrated via multiple PoCs. In order to successfully implement this framework for a Public Health Grid, the authors recommend moving forward with a three-pronged approach focusing on interoperability and standards, streamlining the PHGrid infrastructure, and developing robust and high-impact public health services.","Savel, T.;Hall, K.;Lee, B.;McMullin, V.;Miles, M.;Stinn, J.;White, P.;Washington, D.;Boyd, T.;Lenert, L.;",2,1,pp.523-529,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2010.04.002,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART53433506,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART53433506&type=mobile,Public health .

Business architecture integrates risks due to the predominance in a certain period of development of the banking sector of different business models. Its development should involve the subordination of private interests of the banking business to national and public needs to achieve economic growth. Such a public-private partnership should become an institutional tool for the formation and functioning of a business architecture, based on socially responsible banking.Development directions of business architecture of the Ukrainian banking sector based on public-private partnership are determined by the results of correlation and regression assessment of the impact of business architecture on economic growth in 2015-2020.The generalization of the effects on gross investment and gross consumption allows identifying the following areas for targeted changes in business architecture of the banking sector in Ukraine&rsquo;s economy: 1) reducing the lending activity of banks with retail, corporate, and universal business models; 2) incitement the lending activity of banks with a corporate business model with retail financing and a business model of limited credit intermediation.The paper substantiates the feasibility of transition to mesoprudential banking regulation and supervision. The main priority of this approach is to reduce systemic risks, which is determined by the propensity for similar risks within groups of financial institutions with the same business models.</P>","Kuznyetsova, Аnzhela;Boiarko, &#x406;ryna;Rudevska, Viсtoria;Maslov, Vladyslav;",2,1,pp.150-162,https://doi.org/10.21511/bbs.17(2).2022.13,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120057612,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120057612&type=mobile,,,public architecture

A transition of architectural objects of built environment from market goods towards public or nonmarket goods is presented in literature review. The real estate market value is highly influenced by concepts of externalities and public goods, therefore being highly spatially dependent and making the process of the real estate valuation more complex. The internalization of these externalities and public goods is impossible because of the nature of public space in the city. The concept of value and different types of value, like exchange, use, image, social, environmental, cultural value, are also presented in literature review. These different types of value are transferred to value in exchange when estimating market value. The aim of research is to calculate the amount of the real estate market value that is influenced by externalities, public or nonmarket goods. The process of value transfers between market and public is also discussed in this study. In the research part prices of similar apartments measure the coefficient of variance. Newly constructed apartment buildings with partial finishing interior within city boundaries are selected expecting their price to vary only because of different amount of externalities and public goods available inside district/region of selected building or provided by the actual building itself. The results show that up to 29% of the real estate market value is influenced by public or nonmarket goods.

Such a concept of landscape architecture made its appearance in the last decade of the 20th century, as the flexible network to include the changes and the specificity of the surroundings, which simultaneously focuses on the temporality-the uncertainty. Moreover landscape architecture can be defined as the architecture in which the interest on human activities lie in the center of the concept. By analyzing concrete examples, the landscape architecture can be defined in 3 aspects : unity of building and nature, void and public space, space of expansion. As a result of the analysis of landscape architects' statements, it can be said that the issues of publicity are always put at the starting point of landscape architecture with its attention to the way to associate an individual with the others.",김진엽;김정곤;,2,1,pp.381-389,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIFullTextView?cn=JAKO201208439036808&dbt=JAKO&keyValue=05787966,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201208439036808,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201208439036808&type=mobile,랜드스케이프 . 공공성 . 랜드스케이프 건축 . 공공공간,,public architecture

Public health professionals are embedded within the Faculty of Environment and Technology at the University of the West of England, and contribute to research, pedagogic programme development, teaching and mentoring. The aim was to embed public health concepts and issues into architecture training, to empower the profession as part of the wider workforce, to improve health and wellbeing when designing buildings and places. The PHPiR was evaluated using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Data was collected (questionnaires, focus group, semi-structured interviews, programme documentation) on a Masters of Architecture cohort (N = 34) at intervals from 2011-2019 to see if the PHPiR has long lasting effects as students enter practice.</P><P><B>Results</B></P><P>Public health concepts including; inequalities, life course approach, and social capital, became embedded into the architecture curriculum.

We argue that considering such structures within their local historical contexts offers a better approach to understanding diversity in religious architecture. This study examines great kivas, large public or religious buildings in the prehispanic U.S. Southwest, as potential performance spaces, using structure size to estimate audience capacity relative to community size. We compare circular great kivas present along the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau with rectangular great kivas used in the Transition Zone to the south between the 11th and 14th centuries CE. The two traditions share certain similarities, and some great kivas in the area where the two traditions meet appear to be &ldquo;hybrids.&rdquo; However, examining great kivas as potential performance venues in relationship to the surrounding settlements suggests that the social roles played by rectangular and circular great kivas followed notably different historical trajectories.

Prudent application of digital technologies, particularly Emerging Technologies (ETs) and associated software applications, can serve as a valuable tool to catalyse governance towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While adhering to the principles of good governance. In view of this, the present study is an attempt to first elucidate some global best practices of ETs such as Artificial Intelligence, blockchain, robotic process automation, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to articulate the objectives of similar technology application in inspirational terms for PSD in India. Second, it summarises the challenges about the utilisation and exploitation of such technology implementations in the context of developing countries such as India. Based on learnings emanating from these two objectives, the study establishes that a refurbished approach towards digital governance is the need of the hour. This new approach must be citizen-centric, innovative and citizen-inclusive, as the literature affirms that civic participation is a prerequisite while deploying digital technologies. This inspires the authors to propose a model that is co-created with citizens to address the contextual needs and aspirations of citizenry. The successful implementation of the proposed model insists on the presence of a flexible and responsive legal and regulatory system too. The present study may be useful for public administrators and policy makers in understanding the Indian character of using and creating a sustainable digital architecture for PSD that would go a long way in revamping Public Services 4.0 under the ambit of newer Government 4.0 to achieve SDGs by 2030. </P>","Malhotra, Charru;Anand, Rashmi;Soni, Vivek;",2,1,pp.327-342,https://doi.org/10.1177/0019556120957421,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART109978608,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART109978608&type=mobile,,,public architecture

However, this evolution has to cope with several challenges, such as the provision of sufficient communication capacity, coverage, and resilience as well as deployment costs and efficient exploitation of radio resources. This has triggered the need of new architectural solutions. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous network communication architecture where both infrastructures and spectrum are shared between PS and commercial operators thus reducing deployment costs and times, and addressing the main challenges of PS communications. The shared radio access network (RAN) is managed by means of network slicing and resources virtualization. The proposed architecture is based on a three-tier scheduler that allows to manage different network layers and different RAN slices.

Our implementation of these two problems on the Berkeley open infrastructure for network computing (BOINC) platform demonstrates a runtime reduction factor of 1.15 for sequence alignment and 16.76 for BLAST. While the runtime reduction factor of the global gene sequence alignment application is modest, this value is based on a theoretical sequential runtime extrapolated from the calculation of a smaller problem. Because this runtime is extrapolated from running the calculation in memory, the theoretical sequential runtime would require 37.3 GB of memory on a single system. With this in mind, the BOINC implementation not only offers the reduced runtime, but also the aggregation of the available memory of all participant nodes. If an actual sequential run of the problem were compared, a more drastic reduction in the runtime would be seen due to an additional secondary storage I/O overhead for a practical system. Despite the limitations of the public computer architecture, most notably in communication overhead, it represents a practical platform for grid- and cluster-scale bioinformatics computations today and shows great potential for future implementations.</P>","Pellicer, Stephen;Chen, Guihai;Chan, Keith C.

At different times, this fact has been more or less valued or recognized. For example, during the presidency of Jos&eacute; Manuel Balmaceda (1886-1891), his administration undertook numerous public works that sought to spread modernization throughout the country through buildings and infrastructure. Likewise, during the 1940s, with the boost of the Popular Front governments, there was a sustained institutionalization action that resulted in the construction of numerous buildings, that spread the benefits of modern architecture for public architecture and working-class housing. With the application of a capitalist economic-social model, which privileges market fluctuations, from the 1970s to the present, the private sector has been favored, so that the State&rsquo;s action in the production of the city has been curtailed and, on many occasions, muted or vilified.</P>","Fuentes-Hern&aacute;ndez, Pablo;Cerda-Brintrup, Gonzalo;",2,1,pp.04-07,https://doi.org/10.22320/07196466.2022.40.062.00,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122569413,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122569413&type=mobile,,,public architecture

This study uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on the judgments and opinions of EA team members from three different agencies at federal level. There are 27 assessment criteria which are grouped into six categories, Internal Process, Learning and Growth, Authority Support, Cost, Technology and Talent Management. The top capability of all cases is Internal Process and the top criteria for priority assessment is Authority Support. From the findings it can be concluded that AHP is a useful and cost effective method to assess, priorities and plan for EA implementation. Addressing the capability and priority criteria will ensure the optimum EA is implemented thus it shall reduce the risk of EA implementation failure.","Bakar, N.A.A.;Harihodin, S.;Kama, N.;",2,1,pp.198-206,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2016.09.141,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76554528,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76554528&type=mobile,Enterprise Architecture . assessment . public sector organisation,,public architecture

The proposed architecture presents a unified arithmetic unit which provides the functions of dual-field modular multiplication, dual-field modular addition/subtraction, and dual-field modular inversion. A new adder based on the signed-digit (SD) number representation is provided for carry-propagated and carry-less operations. The critical path of the proposed design is reduced compared with previous full adder implementation methods. Experimental results show that the proposed design can achieve a clock speed of 1GHz using 776K gates in a 0.09&mu;m CMOS standard cell technology, or 150MHz using 5227 CLBs in a Xilinx Virtex 4 FPGA.

NART129381278,JAFO,NJOU00556022,MDPI AG,Religions,;2077-1444;,,121,15,3,2024,,NART129381278,The Meeting: Ideas for an Architecture of Interreligious Civic Collaboration,"<P>Interreligious engagement (IE) has been experienced and theorized mainly as the pursuit of a shared respectful awareness of the beliefs, practices, and social experiences of multiple religious communities. In rare instances, it has been possible to create architecture specifically to foster IE, as in the &ldquo;tri-faith&rdquo; Abrahamic campus in Omaha and the Berlin House of One. The theme is: Here we are, accepting that we share the world. Another form of IE that deserves to attract more interest is multireligious collaboration in civic work (addressing homelessness, urban blight, illiteracy, etc.). Some adherents of the intrinsically cosmopolitan &ldquo;world&rdquo; religions are actively cosmopolitan to the extent of seeking this engagement. The theme is: Let us share the work of the world, including sharing our religiously inflected processing of what the practical issues facing us are. There is a new initiative of this sort in my city, Jackson, Mississippi, named (from M. L. King) the &ldquo;Beloved Community&rdquo;. An architectural thought experiment may prove helpful in articulating the ideals for such an endeavor. What would be the physical desiderata for its headquarters? Let us imagine a new downtown building, The Meeting, dedicated to housing meetings where mixed religious groups learn about civic issues and coordinate efforts to address them. Full interreligious sharing of a space seems to require a neutral design lacking any definite religious inspiration. But there are nonsectarian ways to create an appreciably special, non-ordinary space, as in courtrooms and classrooms. Could a civic IE headquarters be special, expressive of practical optimism, and contain a sufficient religious allusion to qualify as a &ldquo;next-to-sacred space&rdquo; in which religious actors felt supported in the civic extension of their religious lives? I offer suggestions for discussion, including (1) a pavilion-style building suggestive of being set up for a special purpose-not soaringly grandiose but with a vertical feature such as a central roof lantern; (2) at least one major porch, with benches and tables; (3) an outside water fountain with public water supply (a historical allusion to the Islamic sabil); (4) inside, right-sized meeting rooms around the glass-walled periphery; (5) a big &ldquo;living room&rdquo; lounge in the center, usable for larger meetings, with access to a kitchen, and with a big project board for tracking work completed and work in hand next to a large map of the city; (6) a moderate descent of several steps into each meeting room so that there is a feeling of commitment in attending a meeting and a sense of challenge in going forth from one; (7) otherwise a main floor levelness and openness facilitating movement in and out, as in a train station; and (8) upstairs small offices for religious and other qualifying organizations. Answering the aesthetic and practical questions these suggestions raise takes us into imagining civic IE more concretely.</P>","Smith, Steven G.",2,1,pp.360,https://doi.org/10.3390/rel15030360,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART129381278,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART129381278&type=mobile,,,civic architecture

Great kivas, as the most ubiquitous and persistent form of Pueblo public architecture in the area prior to 1280 CE, provide a durable means of assessing community membership and for analyzing how the introduction of other civic-ceremonial buildings may reflect shifts in public space and leadership strategies over time. It is suggested here that great kivas represent a fundamental and enduring symbol of community group assembly that underwent changes over time, the most profound of which occurred in the final decades prior to migration from the area in the late 1200s CE. The overall constellation of civic-ceremonial structures over time indicates altering leadership strategies just prior to the depopulation of the region.","Coffey, G.D.;Ryan, S.C.;",2,1,pp.12-32,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaa.2017.02.002,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART78372462,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART78372462&type=mobile,,,civic architecture

Comparing examples from across Europe reveals profound differences, however, in both the architecture of politics and the politics of architecture; that is, how building projects were administered and how their administration shaped their socio-political significance. Although ranging across the continent, this article is centered on construction in two representative cities: Vienna and London. While the former had a small number of churches, all under the direct control of the mayor and council, the latter had over a hundred, each overseen by locally appointed officers. In Vienna, church construction was, thus, an important field of activity for the city government, which oversaw the work and celebrated its own leadership of the project; in London, it lay outside civic control and offered local opportunities for domination by wealthy families. This difference can be found across the continent, separating the large, old cities of England, northern France, Spain, and the Low Countries, which could have numerous churches, from smaller towns and cities both in these places and across the rest of central, northern, and southern Europe, which typically had a single, major parish church and only a few subordinate ones. This article considers the implications of these two contrasting models-centralized and decentralized, civic and parochial, high government and local politics-on how architectural production functioned as a field of political activity and how church building shaped local distributions and articulations of power in medieval Europe.</P>","Byng, Gabriel",2,1,pp.392-416,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0010417523000464,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART129660736,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART129660736&type=mobile,Vienna .

The analysis focuses on civic neighbourhood project in East London called InterAct while the pivotal point of the project was the building of a piece of temporary architecture, the planning and ongoing construction of a civic neighbourhood involved a much more far-reaching production of material and symbolic artifacts which jointly represent a form of position taking within a site of social, cultural and symbolic struggle (Bourdieu 1993, 30). The study provides a critical description of the InterAct project, illustrating its purpose, goals and rationale and critically examines some of the publicly available discursive artifacts which revolve around it.

However, its concerns in architecture cannot be denied in the last centuries. In the 17th-century Persia, a philosophical movement had effects on the concept of existence, which coincided with the urban developments, and the establishment of novel civic centers. With respect to philosophical backgrounds of architecture, this study aims to interpret the concept of existence in the designs of civic centers. For this purpose, the primacy of existence to essence, and bestowing of presence are illustrated to analyze the presentations in the designs of civic centers in that era.

These models provide an opportunity to connect academia with real-world environments. One connection of particular importance is the one linking engineering education and society: how can engineering education connect learning with some of the most pressing global sustainability challenges we currently face?As a result, universities are turning to communities globally in search for opportunities to connect students with sustainability related issues. The appearance of academic offerings including international courses, global exchanges and fellowships abroad among others, are a testament to the efforts within higher institutions to create these bridges. From a scholarly perspective, literature describing these kinds of community-based programs has been on the rise. However, the majority of these programs, and the research surrounding them, are almost exclusively focused on the potential transformation this connection brings to learners, much less on what community-based interaction means for engineering education transformation. This paper is an effort in bridging that gap.The 'Technology Design for Coffee Production: A Co-Design Experience', is a community-based course on technology design and engineering offered to an interdisciplinary group of graduate students, primarily from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The course was facilitated directly from within coffee farms in Colombia in collaboration with local groups over the course of a month. We conclude that three principles are promising for future community-based engineering education offerings: 1) community immersion; 2) positioning local community members as learning instructors; 3) thick contextualization of the engineering design process. We discuss how each of these principles is reflected in the curriculum of the course, and how they were implemented.Future work includes further examining lessons and expanding them into other engineering education offerings at MIT including a revised second edition of the course to graduate students from all five schools at MIT.</P>","Reynolds-Cuellar, Pedro;Villamil-Mejia, Alejandra;",2,1,pp.1-5,,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13355713,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13355713&type=mobile,,,civic architecture

Is there space for an architecture that has not succumbed to the flattening logic of the market, indistinctly banalizing space either as utilitarian infrastructure or as propagandistic theme park? In other words, is it still possible to construct an architecture underpinned by what we might call &lsquo;humanist&rsquo; values: universality, egalitarianism, and civility - a civic architecture - in the face of a post-humanist critique?

Through this comparison we will examine the Kunsthalle as a typology articulating social ideas through seemingly opposing architectural forms, but, more importantly, we will question whether its underlying ideas and principles could be applicable to the practice of architecture itself. In such a hypothetical scenario we will suggest that the Kunsthalle could be viewed as more than a typology; it could be viewed as a conceptual model conveying the fundamental instability of &lsquo;the civic,&rsquo; and thus challenge architectural culture - its normative forms of subjectivity and attendant social relations - from within.</P>","Shvartzberg, Manuel",2,1,,https://doi.org/10.14324/111.444.amps.2012v1i2.001,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART124781848,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART124781848&type=mobile,,,civic architecture

Reconstruction of cities following earthquake disasters is seen as an opportunity to revisit the components of civic design and refer it to the neighbourhood scale. This paper provides a review of the principles of civic design, later introducing the <I>Civic Life Analytical Framework</I> (CLAF), used to highlight the socio-spatial particularities of heavily affected intermediate cities, setting the basis for an analytical framework in the context of urban reconstruction. The case study of Talca in its post-earthquake reconstruction stage (2010&ndash;2016) delivers empirical grounds, including elements of the social and built-up environmental conditions. The use of CLAF in the northern quarter of Talca involves the observation of morphological aspects, architecture aesthetics, physical structure and dimensions of the collective (public) space, later triangulated with a structured qualitative approach, using data from twenty-two interviews. The results provide a visualization of the main perceptions of residents regarding their sense of agency, community and belonging &ndash; these being constitutive dimensions of civic life. As main findings, civic life in Talca is affected by the polarization of dwelling spaces, impacting the conditions for individuals and families to interact with their surroundings, fostering socially disjointed (public) spaces.

The final section traces his pioneering interest in high-density, low-rise housing, which culminated with the establishment of the Hundred New Towns Association in 1933-34.</P></P>","Shasore, N.E.",2,1,pp.175-203,https://doi.org/10.1017/arh.2018.7,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART107030060,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART107030060&type=mobile,,,civic architecture

To improve the design of such systems, we develop an empirical model of online civic engagement that connects common game mechanics to four key democratic processes and outcomes-inclusion, deliberative engagement, sound and influential public input, and long-term civic impacts. We then link game mechanics and deliberation with theories of motivation to show how these mechanics can leverage people&rsquo;s drives to fulfill basic needs, forge social connections, and gain status. To illustrate our model in more concrete terms, we show how game mechanics could motivate both participants and policymakers in an online participatory budgeting system. We conclude by describing a multi-stage experimental approach to testing this model within an existing system of online participatory budgeting. </P>","Gastil, John;Broghammer, Michael;",2,1,pp.7-25,https://doi.org/10.1177/0032321719890815,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART112228652,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART112228652&type=mobile,,,civic architecture

The deterioration of aging buildings causes that they are becoming vacant and left unmanaged. As a result, the property values and the surrounding environment have declined. For sustainable management of modern architecture, the value and usefulness in the modern society need to be improved. To address this issue, this study focuses on the case of Fukuoka DIY renovation in Japan started by private-driven activities. This study was conducted in three parts. First, it classified the types of activities and actors related to the regeneration and re-use of modern architecture in Fukuoka. Second, it analyzed the relationship and characteristics of activities investigated using the DEMATEL method. Third, it examined the performance capability of stakeholders by drawing the Power-Interest Matrix. The case of Fukuoka DIY renovation shows that the private-driven projects have been extended to the civic groups' activities accompanied with diverse programs and regional expansion. The case indicates the importance of each actors' role and status who involve each activity concerning the regeneration and re-use of modern architecture. In particular, the civic groups perform a role as an intermediary actor to connect a variety of actors and their activities. The community engagement will contribute to sustainable management including the re-use of aging buildings and urban regeneration.",장민영;이명훈;,2,1,pp.77-87,https://doi.org/10.5659/jaik_pd.2017.33.6.77,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIFullTextView?cn=JAKO201719363360550&dbt=JAKO&keyValue=05787966,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201719363360550,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201719363360550&type=mobile,근현대 건축물 . 재생 및 활용 . 지역주체 참여 .
