The author reflect on a project within a postgraduate architectural theory module to address the following questions: How can architectural pedagogy articulate critical modes of production that contribute to quality education in the time of the Anthropocene? What are the ideas, values and practices needed?</P></P><P>Design/methodology/approach<P>The method employed is close reading of texts focussed on three areas: critical theory and pedagogy, political theory and the Anthropocene, and architectural theory and typological urbanism. These theoretical narratives are placed in dialogue with a reflection on a design research pedagogical project. The theoretical narratives and design research project seek to articulate the multidimensionality of critical education. The methodology enacted in the paper performs the pedagogy of the classroom.</P></P><P>Findings<P>The study yields compelling conclusions regarding the potential for rethinking the idea of typology under the pressure of the Anthropocene and of critical pedagogy combined with design research to take positions on urgent political and social matters. The author concludes with a toolkit of concepts, values and knowledge practices.</P></P><P>Originality/value<P>At a time when disciplines tend towards discrete specialisation, while the need for knowledge production is ever more transdisciplinary, this paper develops inventive techniques and conceptual frameworks for supporting approaches where different fields and ideas make contact as a collective task in the era of the Anthropocene. It updates theories of typology to address contemporary pressures.</P></P>","McEwan, Cameron",2,1,pp.478-495,https://doi.org/10.1108/arch-10-2022-0232,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART126905066,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART126905066&type=mobile,,,Architectural Urbanism

Higher urbanization rates in cities may result in high temperature warming, which is known as the Urban Heat Island (UHI). Recently, researchers have revealed pronounced effects based on HW and UHI interactions; however, studies that linked their effects with surface energy fluxes in different urban landscape and climate are still inadequate. This study utilized the Community Land Model (CLM) to assess the effect of HW towards UHI, while considering energy fluxes variations in Seoul, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, and Melbourne, with different climate influences and urban morphologies. Generally, Seoul and Tokyo showed intense HW magnitude from 2000 to 2018 based on the HW indices. The surface energy flux components demonstrated a distinct pattern especially from 11:00 to 17:00, with the exception of sensible heat in Melbourne. Further energy-flux partitioning revealed that changes in the heat storage ratio were most significant in Seoul, with 1.39 partitioning due to its larger impervious area. A smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio of open mid-rise building has enhanced urban warming in Melbourne, whereas smaller impervious and larger pervious road fraction could mitigate urban warming effects in Kuala Lumpur. Seoul showed the highest changes in daytime UHI under HW at 2.01 &deg;C, due to the low convection efficiency in compact high-rise building, while nighttime UHI was highly influenced by heat storage and anthropogenic heat release.</P>   <P><B>Highlights</B></P>  <P> <UL> <LI>  Seoul and Tokyo have more intense heat waves (HWs) during 2000&ndash;2018. </LI> <LI>  Latent heat, heat storage, and net radiation changed consistently from 11:00 to 17:00 during HW events. </LI> <LI>  City that has compact building type contributed to the highest heat storage ratio. </LI> <LI>  Smaller height-to-width (H/W) canyon ratio enhanced urban warming under HWs. </LI> <LI>  Urban heat island was enhanced under HW occurrences. </LI> </UL> </P>","Mohammad Harmay, Nurul Syahira;Choi, Minha;",2,1,pp.108677,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108677,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117041401,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117041401&type=mobile,Heat waves .

Using a telematic large screen event staged across Melbourne and Seoul, the paper evaluates the responses of audiences to examine the politics of cultural and civic engagement. While scholarships on creative clusters predominantly focus on the new value chain of industrial and commercial production that arises as a result of agglomeration, this paper argues that the large screen possesses the capacity not only to invigorate public participation, but as a transnational creative cluster, the networked large screen also possesses the potential to enhance the quality of intercultural communication between Asia and Australia.","Yue, A.;McQuire, S.;Papastergiadis, N.;",2,1,pp.157-164,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccs.2014.06.001,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70277933,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART70277933&type=mobile,Large screen .

Concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere varied widely between the cities over the course of the study, ranging from a low of 24.1&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Melbourne during the winter to a high of 376.2&#x03BC;gm<SUP>&#x2212;3</SUP> in Jakarta during the dry season. Seasonal variations in both TSP and PAH were observed in the tropical cities in the study with higher concentrations during the dry season and lower concentrations during the wet season. TSP and PAH concentrations are correlated with each other in these cities, suggesting that they have related sources and sinks for these cities. In the temperate cities of Melbourne and Seoul, PAH concentrations were higher during the cold winter season and lower during the warm summer. However, TSP was quite variable over the years in these latter cities and no clear seasonal trend was observed. A number of factors have been investigated which could be contributing to seasonal variations in pollutant levels. In the temperate climates, increased emissions due to the use of fossil fuels for heating in the winter is evident. However, an interrogation of the database with respect to the other factors such as (1)increased photolytic degradation during the summer, (2)transport of pollutants from other sources, (3)removal of PAH via wet deposition and in-cloud scavenging mechanisms and (4)volatilisation of lower molecular weight species during periods of high temperature indicates the importance of multiple processes. Even though there are clearly much lower levels of both particulates and PAH in the wet season of the tropical climates, no statistically significant correlations have been observed between rainfall levels and pollutant concentrations.</P>","Panther, B.C.;Hooper, M.A.;Tapper, N.J.;",2,1,pp.4087-4099,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(99)00150-8,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART21829519,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART21829519&type=mobile,TSP .

In Part A, patients were enrolled in a 3+3 combination design with sequentially escalating doses of narmafotinib (100, 200 or 400 mg, qd) to identify a suitable Phase 2 dose. Narmafotinib plasma PK was assessed during monotherapy and Cycle 1. Imaging was conducted every 2 months and evaluated using RECIST 1.1. Part B utilizes a Simon&rsquo;s two-stage design at 400 mg narmafotinib, with the primary objectives of assessing safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination.</P></P><P>Results:<P>Preliminary Phase 1b (Part A) analysis across all doses (14 patients) showed narmafotinib to be generally safe and well-tolerated with promising signs of efficacy indicating a dose-dependent increase in duration of treatment and best response. Five confirmed partial responses (4 at 400 mg narmafotinib; 1 at 200 mg) were recorded and 4/6 patients on 400 mg narmafotinib received treatment for >6 months. A dose of 400 mg qd of narmafotinib was selected for the Phase 2a (Part B) study. Preliminary Part B analysis from the initial 26 patients showed narmafotinib to be generally safe and well-tolerated with promising signs of efficacy, with 10 confirmed partial responses observed to date. The median duration on trial (DoT) continues to demonstrate a significant improvement over the historical gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel combination. Narmafotinib continues to be well-tolerated. Common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) were predominately mild to moderate and included nausea (20.5%), diarrhea (12.8%) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (10.3%).</P></P><P>Conclusions:<P>Preliminary Part B analysis on the initial 26 patients showed narmafotinib to be safe and well-tolerated with promising signs of efficacy.</P></P><P>Citation Format:<P>Terrie-Anne Cock, Sarah Kinkel, Nicole Kruger, Charlotte Mulder, Ananda Sumitra, Marion Harris, Warren Joubert, Lara Lipton, Adnan Nagrial, Nick Pavlakis, Jin Won Kim, Choong-kun Lee, Do-Youn Oh, Joon Oh Park, Woo-Jin Lee, Jason Lickliter, Christopher Burns.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Solving complex problems such as preventing chronic diseases introduces
unique challenges for the creation and application of knowledge, or knowledge to action
(KTA). KTA approaches that apply principles of systems thinking are thought to hold
promise, but practical strategies for their application are not well understood. In this
paper we report the results of a scan of systems approaches to KTA with a goal to
identify how to optimize their implementation and impact.</p>
       </sec>
       <sec>
         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>A 5-person advisory group purposefully selected 9 initiatives to achieve
diversity on issues addressed and organizational forms. Information on each case was
gathered from documents and through telephone interviews with primary contacts
within each organization. Following verification of case descriptions, an inductive
analysis was conducted within and across cases.</p>
       </sec>
       <sec>
         <title>Results</title>
         <p>The cases revealed 5 guidelines for moving from conceiving KTA systems to
implementing them: 1) establish and nurture relationships, 2) co-produce and curate
knowledge, 3) create feedback loops, 4) frame as systems interventions rather than
projects, and 5) consider variations across time and place.</p>
       </sec>
	   <sec>
         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Results from the environmental scan are a modest start to translating
systems concepts for KTA into practice. Use of the strategies revealed in the scan may
improve KTA for solving complex public health problems. The strategies themselves will
benefit from the development of a science that aims to understand adaptation and
ongoing learning from policy and practice interventions, strengthens enduring
relationships, and fills system gaps in addition to evidence gaps. Systems approaches
to KTA will also benefit from robust evaluations.</p>

The development of the proposed design strategy is based on a methodology with elements from &ldquo;Knowledge to Action (KTA),&rdquo; &ldquo;Action research&rdquo; and a &ldquo;List of value concepts.&rdquo; The rigid timetable guaranteed systematic progress, where both knowledge from the end-users and experts were incorporated throughout the decision-making process.</P></P><P>Findings<P>The two case studies documented results involving end-users and experts in a systematic way. In conclusion, it was apparent that the use of interdisciplinary collaboration informed the design outcome.</P></P><P>Practical implications<P>Based on the two cases, the following advice can be given to the architectural profession: architects should use the KTA model or similar in order to target the search for relevant interdisciplinary knowledge and ensure that relevant evidence is involved in the design process of upcoming projects regarding sport and recreation. Architects should make the design process transparent so that one can see which design decisions have been made through the design process. This must be done to ensure that there is greater coherence between vision and practice.</P></P><P>Originality/value<P>The study showed how architects could import knowledge, skills and values from other disciplines such as environmental psychology and active living research to improve the decision-making process of future sport and recreation projects. It was also clear that this design decision process could be made more transparent in the effort to allow the various stakeholders to take ownership of the resulting design outcomes.</P></P>","Hjort, Mikkel;Martin, W.

The aim of this study was to examine housing and support needs and preferences of people with MS with the intention to inform the planning of a co-designed intervention based on the study&rsquo;s findings. Methods Using the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework, quantitative (n = 79) and qualitative (n = 6) data from people with MS were extracted and integrated from projects completed by the research team that explored the housing and support needs and preferences of people with disability. Results were synthesised and presented to a reference group for validation, contextualisation, and adaptation to the Australian context. Results High physical support needs were common across participants. People most commonly required home modifications to improve accessibility, such as ramps, equipment such as heating and cooling, and assistive technology. Many people required more than 8 hours per day of paid support. Moving into individualised housing facilitated independence and community reintegration. People reported gaps between what they wanted from support workers and what they received, citing individual and systemic barriers. Conclusion People with MS have support needs that require proactive and responsive funding arrangements, housing design and support provision. In line with KTA principles, findings will inform the planning of a co-designed intervention that involves people with lived experience of MS and other stakeholders to influence policy and improve home and living outcomes for this population.</P>","Cubis, Lee;McDonald, Sharyn;Dean, Pamela;Ramme, Robin;D’Cruz, Kate;Topping, Megan;Fisher, Fiona;Winkler, Di;Douglas, Jacinta;",2,1,,https://doi.org/10.1071/ib23102,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART131268411,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART131268411&type=mobile,,,KTA projects

ART003066051,JAKO,,한국공간디자인학회,한국공간디자인학회 논문집,;;,,,19,2,2024,,ART003066051,Analyzing Public Access and Boundary Utilization in Landscape Architecture,"(Background and Purpose) In contemporary society, Landscape Architecture crucially addresses the relationships between architecture and landscape, as well as individual and public realms within cities, establishing boundaries as areas with potential for communication while maintaining continuity between buildings and land. Despite the existence of developments ranging from single buildings to large-scale urban projects, many boundary and green spaces are currently applied in cities in isolated and passive ways, with limited functionality in terms of accessibility and publicness. Furthermore, the potential of Landscape Architecture to function diversely within urban environments is underutilized due to a lack of research on its boundary components and methods, compounded by uniform regulations. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes using the boundary spaces of buildings as a solution to practical urban problems, examining the construction methods and components of Landscape Architecture's boundary spaces to advance the concept of 'publicness' in both current and future architectural developments. (Method) This research employs case studies to examine the integration methods of Landscape Architecture within urban conditions, leveraging landscape concepts to bridge diverse aspects and elements. The study emphasizes the critical elements of Landscape Architecture, such as the rates of 'open area' and 'openness,' by investigating international architectural projects. These case studies are instrumental in understanding the types, access, efficiency, and rates of open areas, which are pivotal in expressing the public usage of Landscape Architectures numerically. (Results) The boundary spaces of Landscape Architecture, reflecting the urban context and locality, have shown high potential for public use and were categorized for analysis accordingly. This study introduced an innovative 'publicness graph,' linking objective indicators like 'public area ratio' and 'openness' to visualize detailed characteristics. By defining the Public Occupancy Index (POI) and Balance Deviation Index (BDI), the study quantitatively categorized the 'publicness' of individual buildings, which had previously been expressed qualitatively. (Conclusions) The study concludes that Landscape Architecture holds the potential to revolutionize the design and functionality of public spaces within urban landscapes. Through case analysis and conceptual establishment of the use of boundary spaces in landscape architecture, a quantitative analysis method has been presented. By applying the types of 'Street type', 'Park type', and 'Street + Park type' as case studies, the validity of the analytical method that quantifies the individual characteristics of buildings associated with publicness proposed in this paper has been confirmed. The analysis method based on the 'Publicness Graph' is expected to contribute significantly to the development of design plans and models that can optimize the public use of increasingly complex boundary spaces in modern architecture.",장재우;이상윤;,0,0,pp.107-120,http://dx.doi.org/10.35216/kisd.2024.19.2.107,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003066051,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003066051,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003066051&type=mobile,,,public architecture

Since sustainability is linked to public values, research on sustainable public spaces is an important way to secure sustainability in cities. Based on this, we analyzed the sustainability of European cities by examining the design methods of public architecture according to the region. The aim of the study is to derive architectural methodology corresponding to local characteristics, and to suggest issues to consider in public architecture design to promote urban sustainability based on this. First, regarding the environmental aspect, it can be observed that there is an effort to secure sustainability. Second, in terms of social sustainability, historical value remains as a trace of architectural place, so that it continues in people&rsquo;s memory. In addition, public architecture provides public places where citizens can gather and enjoy programs, while the architectural methods showed differences influenced by cultural conditions. Third, in economic sustainability, it was shown that energy saving was achieved through cost reduction through recycling of materials, facilities, or environmental factors. In conclusion, the issues to be considered in public architectural design are the voiding of urban space through architectural devices in the construction method. In other words, the intention is to form &ldquo;ground&rdquo; that attempts to be part of the city, and thereby create better places. Since skin and material have a deep relationship with the environment, they should have the durability and an outer skin that are suitable for the regional environment. Finally, sustainability is to be utilized through the influx of programs that meet local and environmental characteristics. Design research into public architecture that is oriented towards urban sustainability will be a task to be carried out by the present generation for the millennial generation.</P>","Kim, Soomi;Kwon, Hyun-ah;",2,1,pp.1249,https://doi.org/10.3390/su10041249,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART90662159,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART90662159&type=mobile,,,public architecture

NART129381278,JAFO,NJOU00556022,MDPI AG,Religions,;2077-1444;,,121,15,3,2024,,NART129381278,The Meeting: Ideas for an Architecture of Interreligious Civic Collaboration,"<P>Interreligious engagement (IE) has been experienced and theorized mainly as the pursuit of a shared respectful awareness of the beliefs, practices, and social experiences of multiple religious communities. In rare instances, it has been possible to create architecture specifically to foster IE, as in the &ldquo;tri-faith&rdquo; Abrahamic campus in Omaha and the Berlin House of One. The theme is: Here we are, accepting that we share the world. Another form of IE that deserves to attract more interest is multireligious collaboration in civic work (addressing homelessness, urban blight, illiteracy, etc.). Some adherents of the intrinsically cosmopolitan &ldquo;world&rdquo; religions are actively cosmopolitan to the extent of seeking this engagement. The theme is: Let us share the work of the world, including sharing our religiously inflected processing of what the practical issues facing us are. There is a new initiative of this sort in my city, Jackson, Mississippi, named (from M. L. King) the &ldquo;Beloved Community&rdquo;. An architectural thought experiment may prove helpful in articulating the ideals for such an endeavor. What would be the physical desiderata for its headquarters? Let us imagine a new downtown building, The Meeting, dedicated to housing meetings where mixed religious groups learn about civic issues and coordinate efforts to address them. Full interreligious sharing of a space seems to require a neutral design lacking any definite religious inspiration. But there are nonsectarian ways to create an appreciably special, non-ordinary space, as in courtrooms and classrooms. Could a civic IE headquarters be special, expressive of practical optimism, and contain a sufficient religious allusion to qualify as a &ldquo;next-to-sacred space&rdquo; in which religious actors felt supported in the civic extension of their religious lives? I offer suggestions for discussion, including (1) a pavilion-style building suggestive of being set up for a special purpose-not soaringly grandiose but with a vertical feature such as a central roof lantern; (2) at least one major porch, with benches and tables; (3) an outside water fountain with public water supply (a historical allusion to the Islamic sabil); (4) inside, right-sized meeting rooms around the glass-walled periphery; (5) a big &ldquo;living room&rdquo; lounge in the center, usable for larger meetings, with access to a kitchen, and with a big project board for tracking work completed and work in hand next to a large map of the city; (6) a moderate descent of several steps into each meeting room so that there is a feeling of commitment in attending a meeting and a sense of challenge in going forth from one; (7) otherwise a main floor levelness and openness facilitating movement in and out, as in a train station; and (8) upstairs small offices for religious and other qualifying organizations. Answering the aesthetic and practical questions these suggestions raise takes us into imagining civic IE more concretely.</P>","Smith, Steven G.",2,1,pp.360,https://doi.org/10.3390/rel15030360,,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART129381278,http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART129381278&type=mobile,,,civic architecture
